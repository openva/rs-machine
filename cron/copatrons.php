# GATHER AND RECORD BILL COPATRONS
# By Waldo Jaquith <waldo@jaquith.org>
# 02/15/2010
#
# PURPOSE
# This gathers from LIS all of the copatrons for every bill, one by one.
#
# NOTES
# This won't work if called on its own--it will only function when invoked from within
# update_db.php.
###

/*
	QUESTIONS
	* Don't we already have a method of tracking when we last updated full text, summaries, etc.
	  in the bills table and, if so, can't we employ that here to do something more intelligent
	  than update a random subset?
	* What is the maximum query rate before LIS shuts us down?
	* Doesn't this need a shim to allow for the initial update?
