Abigail Spanberger signed bills to set a referendum for four constitutional amendments  — some of which have been years in the making — officially sending them to Virginians to weigh in on this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first three amendments, if approved by voters this November, will protect reproductive rights and same-sex marriages and allow people with felony convictions who have completed their sentences to automatically have their voting rights restored. The amendments were a campaign promise for Spanberger and Democrats, who gained majorities in the legislature in the 2023 and 2025 elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fourth amendment, which has drawn both praise and condemnation, would allow a mid-decade redistricting of the state’s congressional maps.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lDPzERygkU"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/02/05/virginia-democrats-release-long-awaited-10-1-congressional-map/">Virginia Democrats release long-awaited 10–1 congressional map</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leading Democrats </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/02/05/virginia-democrats-release-long-awaited-10-1-congressional-map/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said this week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the effort is necessary to “level the playing field,” after President Donald Trump prompted states to redraw their maps in ways that tilt favor towards Republicans. Democratic-led states like California, and now Virginia, have countered with their own processes. Republicans have denounced it as partisan gerrymandering that flouts democratic principles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic leadership of the legislature summoned lawmakers to a special session last fall to pass the fourth constitutional amendment — as amendments need to pass two legislative sessions in a row with a House of Delegates election in between. As the 2026 legislative session kicked off this year the chambers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/14/virginia-house-democrats-advance-four-constitutional-amendments-on-opening-day-of-2026-session/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wasted no time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in getting the bills to Spanberger. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Governor says redistricting amendment is ‘temporary and responsive’ </h4>

	</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_46470" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-46470 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/proposed-2026-redistricting-map-scaled.png" alt="" width="2560" height="1356" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/proposed-2026-redistricting-map-scaled.png 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/proposed-2026-redistricting-map-300x159.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/proposed-2026-redistricting-map-1024x542.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/proposed-2026-redistricting-map-768x407.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/proposed-2026-redistricting-map-1536x814.png 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/proposed-2026-redistricting-map-2048x1085.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Virginia Democrats&#8217; proposed 10-D, 1-R congressional districts map preserves the broad outlines of some existing districts but redistributes how the population is grouped across much of the state.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she signed the bill for the fourth amendment, Spanberger called the mid-decade redistricting proposal  a “temporary and responsive” measure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of releasing the maps on Thursday, Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas,D-Portsmouth, framed the redistricting push as a means to counter the GOP-led gerrymandering supported by Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Look, Donald Trump knows he’s going to lose the midterms. He knows it,” Lucas said. “That’s why he started this mess in the first place. … These are not ordinary times and Virginia will not sit on the sidelines while it happens.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have pushed back against the proposal at every step of the way — arguing that Virginia ostensibly ended gerrymandering in 2020 with a previous constitutional amendment and claiming that existing maps are fair. A legal challenge to the amendment is now up for review by the </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/04/virginia-supreme-court-will-hear-redistricting-challenge-00765490?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Supreme Court.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican leadership has also argued that the redistricting attempt is a diversion from key priorities. While a variety of bills aimed at affordability are advancing through both chambers, none have made it to Spanberger’s desk yet for potential signature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a chat with reporters on Friday after Spanberger’s bill signing, House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, took aim at the proposed maps. With a cluster of compact districts tied to Fairfax County in Northern Virginia, he pointed out how it benefits the Democratic stronghold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are we going to Fairfax the rest of Virginia?&#8221; Kilgore posited. “These are not fair lines.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerning all the amendments, Kilgore said his party is “going to have to continue to fight those as we move through this, and hopefully the voters will agree with where we are.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger said voters can expect to see her out and about later this year to support Congressional candidates and stump for the voting rights, marriage equality and reproductive rights amendments, but didn’t divulge how much advocacy she might lend to the redistricting amendment this spring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The redistricting amendment timing is a bit different, and there&#8217;s certain restrictions related to our ability to fundraise,” she said when asked how else she would support the measure ahead of the bill signings on Friday. “So within the constraints, certainly that exists in a very different manner.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginian politicians are not allowed to fundraise during the legislative session so any campaigning, messaging and public events related to the amendment won’t ramp up until the 2026 legislative session adjourns in mid-March. The referendum for the amendment is </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/generalassembly/2026-01-22/virginia-house-congressional-redistricting-gerrymandering-referendum-torian" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">set for April 21</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which makes for tight turnaround. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats currently hold six of the state’s 11 Congressional seats, and the new 10-1 map will likely bolster their representation. While the often-competitive 2nd Congressional District  remains largely intact in Democrats’ proposed map, most other districts have been reworked to favor more Democrats and clump Republican representation into a single district spanning much of Southwest Virginia. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Voting rights amendment would make restoration automatic for former felons</h4>

	</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_46477" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-46477 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8703-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8703-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8703-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8703-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8703-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8703-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8703-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Gov. Abigail Spanberger signs bills to set referendums for four constitutional amendments on Feb. 6, 2026. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When Virginians have paid their debt to society, they deserve to regain their right to vote,” Spanberger said of the voting rights amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently, Virginians with felony convictions  permanently lose their voting rights unless a governor restores them. Three previous governors from both parties had streamlined the approvals by tweaking certain eligibility criteria and making the process automatic, so long as a prison sentence was complete. Former Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Spanberger&#8217;s predecessor, </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/surovell-spruill-ask-if-youngkin-has-changed-rights-restoration-process/article_dd1232ba-c4fb-11ed-8b57-3723c72fb438.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shifted back</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a petition process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With reductions in approvals, there was also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/23/these-virginians-wont-be-able-to-vote-next-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">little criteria </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to guide applicants on whether their petitions would be successful or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several rejected applicants told The Mercury in 2024 that they were dismayed not to be able to participate in the presidential election and their local city councils. Having already repaid the debt to society that Spanberger referenced Friday, the rejected applicants were eager to once again engage in democracy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, bore a large grin on Friday as the governor signed the bill. Aside from being the state’s first Black speaker, Scott has gone from past imprisonment for a felony conviction to public service and political leadership. He said previously he supports this amendment based on his personal experience and would like others like him to benefit from it.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Marriage equality amendment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After signing the bill to send the marriage equality amendment to voters, Spanberger hugged Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, the bill’s sponsor in the Senate and one of the state’s openly gay elected officials. It is one of Ebbin’s last pieces of legislation before he joins Spanberger’s administration as a senior adviser to the Cannabis Control Authority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure would cement protections for gay marriage in the state’s Consitution, to ensure same-sex unions would still be legal in Virginia even if federal protections are stripped away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has expressed interest in revisiting a pivotal case that solidified federal gay marriage rights. If the nation’s highest court were to strike down the protections, Virginia&#8217;s defunct 2006 ban would take effect unless removed. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reproductive rights battle could ramp up later this year</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After signing the amendment that would codify reproductive rights protections in the state Constitution, Spanberger said in a statement that Virginia women “deserve the freedom to make their own reproductive healthcare decisions without politicians dictating their choices.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If approved by voters latest this year, the amendment would protect access to fertility treatments and contraception as well as the ability to get abortions or use abortion medications to manage active miscarriages, which can prevent infection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have advocated for these protections for the past several years, and the amendment cleared the legislature </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/19/virginia-lawmakers-send-reproductive-rights-amendment-toward-november-vote/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Republicans in Virginia have voted in support of the measure. They have cited concerns that the amendment would allow abortion up to the “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/13/virginia-democrats-do-not-support-infanticide-but-heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-they-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">moment of birth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” — though infanticide remains illegal under </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter4/section18.2-71.1/#:~:text=Partial%20birth%20infanticide%3B%20penalty.,of%20a%20Class%204%20felony." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1531" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> law — and that the proposal doesnt’ reiterate existing laws about parental consent and care for newborns.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also some who simply do not support abortion unless it is needed to save someone’s life or if the pregnancy was the result of rape and incest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The redistricting push will likely dominate political headlines in the coming months, but support and opposition campaigns for the other three amendments — particularly the reproductive rights one — are likely to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/19/virginia-lawmakers-send-reproductive-rights-amendment-toward-november-vote/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accelerate as Congressional midterms approach</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Democratic House subcommittee early Friday morning advanced a broad slate of bills aimed at tightening how U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement can operate in Virginia. Lawmakers and supporters say the package of proposals is designed to protect access to courts, schools, polling places and other sensitive locations while restoring public trust shaken by recent federal immigration enforcement activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measures, many of which were consolidated because of overlapping goals, now head to the full House Public Safety Committee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taken together, the bills would require judicial warrants for certain civil immigration arrests in courthouses and other public facilities, restrict immigration enforcement near polling places, limit cooperation between state and local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities, and impose new penalties on officers who conceal their identities or impersonate federal agents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The subcommittee’s action comes amid heightened scrutiny of ICE activity across the commonwealth, including reports of masked or unidentified agents conducting civil arrests in and around courthouses cited by lawmakers. The courthouse arrests are a shift from prior federal policy that has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats and immigrant-rights advocates.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Courthouse arrest limits anchor broader ICE enforcement package</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the central bills moving forward is </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB650" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 650</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Del. Katrina Callsen, D-Albemarle, which passed on a 4-1 party-line vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would prohibit most civil arrests in courthouses without a judicial warrant or order and shield people required to attend court — along with their family members, witnesses and others accompanying them — from civil arrest while traveling to, attending or leaving court proceedings. Any violation could be punished as contempt of court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This bill is responsive to ICE enforcement activities that are happening in courthouses,” Callsen told the subcommittee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since January 2025, ICE has reversed longstanding policies and started ramping up warrantless civil and administrative arrests within our courthouses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said agents have appeared “sometimes masked and often unidentified,” creating confusion for court personnel and fear among victims and witnesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If people are afraid to come to court, it hurts us all,” Callsen said, adding that the bill would codify the long-standing principle that arrests in courthouses require a warrant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of their similar scope, lawmakers voted to merge several other proposals into Callsen’s bill before sending it forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among them was </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1260" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1260</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Irene Shin, D-Fairfax, which would require public K-12 schools to notify parents and staff if federal immigration enforcement officers are present on school property and would bar access to nonpublic school areas without a judicial warrant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would impose similar notification and warrant requirements at public colleges and universities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shin said the proposal mirrors laws adopted in other states and was shaped by concerns in her district. In Herndon, she said, parents have seen immigration enforcement activity near school drop-off and pick-up times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems like a pretty crazy time to go and prey on vulnerable communities,” Shin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She emphasized that the bill distinguishes between judicial warrants and administrative paperwork, requiring the former to access nonpublic spaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also folded into Callsen’s measure was </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1265" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1265</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Jackie Glass, D-Norfolk, which largely mirrors Callsen’s courthouse protections. Glass said similar laws have already withstood federal challenges in other states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have defended themselves against the federal government,” she said of New York. “So that’s proof that the concept works, it’s necessary.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two other bills by Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington, were also merged into the courthouse proposal. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1440" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1440</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would prohibit federal immigration enforcement in nonpublic spaces of certain “protected areas,” including schools, hospitals, commonwealth’s attorney offices and other facilities designated by the attorney general, unless authorized by a judicial warrant or subpoena. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1442" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1442</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would bar immigration enforcement activities within 40 feet of polling places, election board meetings or recount sites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez framed the proposals as a defense of core civic functions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The commonwealth has a right and duty to ensure that we have free and fair elections,” he said of the polling-place restrictions, arguing that immigration enforcement near voting locations could intimidate eligible voters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On protected areas, Lopez said the goal is to prevent “harassment by federal agents in areas that would provide important community services, like education, health care, and legal assistance.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Lawmakers target officer anonymity and impersonation concerns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the merged package, the subcommittee advanced several standalone bills targeting related issues.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1482" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1482</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by Del. Charlie Schmidt, D-Richmond, passed 4-1 and would prohibit state and local law-enforcement officers from wearing most facial coverings while performing their duties, with exceptions for health protection and SWAT operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would also require officers to visibly display identification and create criminal penalties and civil liability for violations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christian Martinez Lemus of CASA, speaking in support, cited a December incident in which a masked individual posing as an ICE agent went door to door in Northern Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When people can’t tell the difference between real law enforcement and imposters, it creates fear that prevents them from seeking help when they need it,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">April Breslaw of the Virginia Grassroots Coalition echoed those concerns, telling lawmakers that anonymity “undermines public trust, endangers public safety, and hinders legitimate law enforcement operations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The panel also approved </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1492" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1492</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Shin, which would increase penalties for impersonating a federal law-enforcement officer, elevating the offense to a felony. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two bills addressing cooperation between Virginia law enforcement and federal immigration authorities were combined and also passed 4-1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measures follow Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/02/04/spanberger-ends-ice-agreement-involving-virginia-state-police-and-corrections-officers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 12</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, issued earlier this week, which formally ended an agreement with the U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement that allowed Virginia State Police and state correctional officers to assist with federal immigration operations. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1441" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1441</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by Lopez, would bar state and local officers from assisting in federal immigration enforcement unless required by law or presented with a valid judicial warrant, subpoena or detainer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1438" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1438</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by Del. Elizabeth Guzman, D-Prince William, would prohibit state agencies from entering agreements that deputize officers as federal immigration agents and require existing agreements to be terminated by September 2026.</span></p>

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the wake of Hurricane Helene, local response was critical to clearing roads and activating rescues in Southwest Virginia while state and federal resources were on the way. But despite regular flooding and severe weather statewide — including recent snow and ice storms that immobilized much of the commonwealth for days — many localities don’t have a person solely dedicated to emergency management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through House Bill 169 and Senate Bill 98, state legislators attempted to set aside $5 million in the state budget to match localities’ funding to hire full-time emergency managers. The funding proposal was nixed amid budget debates and on Thursday, and the bill was shifted into a stakeholder group to determine how Virginia can better tackle the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What (Helene) also demonstrated was that we weren&#8217;t prepared. We weren&#8217;t coordinating in the ways that we should,”  bill patron Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, said. “The localities weren&#8217;t coordinating in the ways that they should. We were not sharing information in the ways that we should. We didn&#8217;t have even the equipment to do some of the things that we needed to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia law requires that a political subdivision appoint an emergency coordinator; localities often task fire or police chiefs and other local government leaders with this responsibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents of the bill said that when emergency management isn’t the primary focus of whoever embodies the coordinator role, it can be challenging for them to focus on looking for grants, cultivating contacts and training. It can also make it tricky to coordinate with state emergency response efforts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we don&#8217;t already have the contact, we generally have a network of folks that can get us the right contact pretty quickly,” said Brian Misner, a member of the Virginia Emergency Management Association (VEMA). “It’s our way to help make sure that that scene can be stabilized and start recovering faster. It takes that load off of the folks who are working on scene so they can focus on the most immediate public safety threats.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Department of Emergency Management’s 2025 </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2025/RD1043/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, just 44% of 140 Virginia counties, cities and towns have an emergency manager primarily dedicated to the role.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Almost 2 million Virginians live in a locality without at least one full time employee spending at least 75% of their time on emergency management activities,” the report reads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The report also found that just 29% of localities said they have sufficient emergency management program staffing levels. More than 5 million Virginians live in an area “without sufficient staffing to maintain the critical functions within (the) EM program,” the report stated.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With sweeping cuts to federal funding coming from Congress, there are growing concerns over the Virginia Department of Emergency Management’s budget, because two-thirds of its funding come from the federal government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reductions to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s functions that push more of the responsibility to the states also pose serious challenges, emergency management professionals warned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you&#8217;ve got a state agency that&#8217;s two-thirds funded by federal grants, when that&#8217;s tenuous, and then you don&#8217;t have the capabilities at the state level, it&#8217;s really leaving Virginia in a very vulnerable position, which is why we need this to figure out the best path forward,” said Rob Bohannon with the Virginia Emergency Management Association..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers agreed that the state can’t afford delays in response to natural disasters, whether it be a hurricane in the mountains or flooding on the coast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s a long term trickle down in the fiscal impact of the commonwealth by not having the appropriate infrastructure across communities in both pre planning, but also the post incident, which we&#8217;ve seen time and time again,” said Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William. “Because there is a town manager, county administrator, who&#8217;s also the emergency manager, or a public works director who&#8217;s also the emergency manager. There&#8217;s all sorts of roles and combinations, and we&#8217;ve got to start to get this right.”</span></p>

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB454" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bills </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that could allow by-right zoning for apartment buildings, townhomes and mixed-use developments in certain commercial corridors cleared the Senate Thursday, one of several proposals to boost housing supply working through the Virginia legislature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Framing it as “housing near jobs,” sponsor Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, emphasized that his measure can help address Virginia’s housing  shortage and particularly benefit public servants such as teachers, firefighters, law enforcement officers and service industry workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VanValkenburg, a public school teacher himself, said a key reason he’s been able to live near his day job is because he was able to purchase a home several years ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Teachers that are starting out in the profession now cannot afford to buy a house in Western Henrico,” he said at a recent press conference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Danica Roem, D-Prince William, who supported the bill, added that it could help reduce traffic congestion, as people living in walkable areas with lots of nearby businesses might be less reliant on cars. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Clark with the Virginia Home Builders Association said in an interview that stalled approval processes hinder developers from getting more housing online and they end up losing money in the process. Allowing for multifamily housing in commercial spaces by-right could mean faster approval processes by local governments, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Getting site plan approval, rezoning processes, these can take years and upwards of a million dollars,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to streamline the process is “sometimes one of the most attractive things to a development.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea hasn’t attracted much favor from Republican lawmakers, however. They have </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/01/21/housing-proposals-spark-clash-over-state-and-local-roles-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expressed concern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about state overreach into local governments’ authority on various housing proposals over the years. Despite Democrats controlling both chambers, the proposal </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/SB839" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fell in committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With VanValkenburg’s version and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB816" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Dan Helmer,D-Fairfax’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> versions having cleared each chamber this year, they will likely make it to Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s desk. The idea is among several bills aimed at increasing housing affordability and supply that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/22/with-youngkin-gone-democrats-see-opening-on-housing-reform/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">may align with the governor’s agenda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helmer said at a press conference recently about the bills that he is “encouraged” by the momentum on housing policy that his colleagues and Spanberger have been discussing over the past year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the legislative session approaching its midpoint Feb. 18, all bills that have cleared a chamber must be reviewed by the other one. Should they pass there, Spanberger will have the chance to sign, veto or amend them. </span></p>

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After weeks of buildup and a missed self-imposed Jan. 30 deadline, Virginia Democrats on Thursday evening finally released their long-awaited revised congressional map, proposing an aggressive 10–1 configuration that would tilt 10 of the state’s 11 U.S. House districts toward their party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed congressional map leaves several of Virginia’s largest districts visually intact while concentrating most of its changes in Northern and central Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new plan preserves the broad outlines of some existing districts but redistributes how the population is grouped across much of the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 9th District remains a single, expansive district in the state’s far southwestern corner. The Eastern Shore–based 2nd District is also preserved, maintaining a clear coastal anchor on the map.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most visible changes are in Northern and central Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Districts now clustered in the state’s northeastern corner — particularly the 8th, 10th and 11th — are reconfigured and spread farther south and west, while several mid-state districts, including the 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th, are reshaped into a tighter patchwork than under the current map.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a news conference at the state Capitol in Richmond earlier in the day, legislative leaders said the maps reflect what they describe as an extraordinary political moment nationally, as Democrats move forward despite a court order halting the process and </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/04/virginia-supreme-court-will-hear-redistricting-challenge-00765490?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a pending decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Virginia Supreme Court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House and Senate leaders </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/27/democrats-push-redistricting-amendment-as-special-session-jolts-virginia-ahead-of-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pitched</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the proposal as a response to recent Republican-led redistricting efforts in other states and emphasized that Virginia voters — not lawmakers — will ultimately decide the maps’ fate in an April referendum.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, argued the proposal is necessary </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to counter what Democrats describe as a coordinated national strategy driven by President Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Look, Donald Trump knows he’s going to lose the midterms. He knows it,” Lucas said Thursday. “That&#8217;s why he started this mess in the first place. … These are not ordinary times and Virginia will not sit on the sidelines while it happens.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas said Republicans have already moved aggressively in states such as Texas, North Carolina, Missouri and Ohio to redraw congressional lines ahead of the 2026 elections, forcing Democrats in Virginia to respond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, echoed that message, saying the General Assembly has been working for weeks to prepare the maps for public release. “Virginia to the rescue,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 10–1 map “levels the playing field, and we’re ready to move forward,” Scott said. “We’ll get those maps released and put them out in the open and allow them to be debated the way they should be in a democracy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican leaders denounced the plan Thursday morning and said their counterparts aren’t concentrating on solutions to the financial strain many Virginians are facing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Democrats are focused on political gerrymandering instead of focusing on affordability,” said Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The bills they are moving through the legislature are going to cost Virginians more money. It is taking money out of their pocket. But they’re more worried about political gerrymandering games and not Virginians, not the struggles that they are going through.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The map’s release comes amid ongoing litigation over Democrats’ mid-decade redistricting amendment, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/16/virginia-senate-democrats-advance-mid-decade-redistricting-amendment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which cleared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the General Assembly earlier this year but </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/27/virginia-court-strikes-down-redistricting-amendment-headed-for-april-ballot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was struck down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week by a Tazewell County Circuit Court judge. </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Redistricting.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ordered lawmakers to stop the redistricting process, arguing the amendment violated the Virginia Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case is now before the Virginia Supreme Court, which is expected to hear arguments later this month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the uncertainty, Democratic leaders said they remain committed to proceeding with a statewide referendum on </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/generalassembly/2026-01-22/virginia-house-congressional-redistricting-gerrymandering-referendum-torian" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">April 21</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, when voters are set to decide whether to grant lawmakers authority to redraw congressional districts outside the once-a-decade redistricting cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the state Constitution, amendments must pass two separately elected General Assemblies and then be approved by voters. Democrats completed the legislative portion of that process earlier this year, but the court ruling has cast doubt on whether the referendum can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">legally proceed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott said he believes the judge exceeded his authority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You never want to speak ahead, you never know what a judge or jury are going to do,” Scott said. “But I think the law is clearly on our side. I think the judge overreached.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott said the ruling relied on constitutional provisions that do not apply to the amendment process and predicted higher courts would reverse it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think at the end of the day, (the Virginia) Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court will see the judge used the wrong sections of the Constitution to justify his argument,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the legal challenge, Democratic leaders are moving forward with legislation that would implement the new maps </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/28/va-democrats-roll-out-redistricting-amendment-to-counter-gop-map-changes-in-other-states/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only if voters approve</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them via referendum. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott said the writ setting the referendum has already been approved by the General Assembly and is currently on Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s desk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The calling has already been done,” Scott said. “And then the next thing is, we’re going to put the language in the bill with the maps in it in the caboose bill that we’re going to pass.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott said Spanberger has already reviewed the maps, though the governor has not publicly endorsed the 10–1 configuration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The governor has seen the maps,” Scott said. “We wouldn’t be standing here if the governor had not seen the maps. I’m going to let the governor speak for herself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger’s team </span><a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/politics/abigail-spanberger-louise-lucas-virginia/65-5305d159-e8bb-4b44-8890-a1ad2cfa075d" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told WUSA9</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Thursday that the map could be implemented before referendum voting begins, underscoring the governor’s role in ensuring the process can move forward if the courts allow it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her office has not publicly embraced any specific configuration, instead emphasizing that the ultimate choice should rest with Virginia voters and that the executive branch will act to administer the election should the constitutional amendment pass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas acknowledged that many Virginians favor the nonpartisan redistricting commission approved by voters in 2020 and said Democrats still intend to return to that system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The plan is for us to go back to the nonpartisan commission because that’s what Virginians voted for,” Lucas said. “The only reason we&#8217;re in this place right now is because of the power grab that started with Trump.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Lucas and Scott rejected claims that the maps were drawn to benefit specific incumbents, despite </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2026/02/04/macy-says-political-factions-in-richmond-and-washington-want-to-draw-maps-in-backrooms-to-favor-career-politicians/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reporting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of internal Democratic debates over whether to pursue a 9–2 or 10–1 configuration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats currently hold six of the state’s 11 congressional districts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This was never about drawing a seat for a particular candidate,” Lucas said. “This was always about making sure that we defend democracy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott dismissed concerns that sitting lawmakers influenced the lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’ve been paying attention to these last elections, you don&#8217;t know who the heck is going to win in these primaries,” he said. “Whatever happens, happens to that point.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked who drew the maps, Scott said the legislature worked with outside consultants, but he declined to say more about the mapmaking process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have some consultants. We’re not going to get into the details, but you all will be able to see it,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas said Democrats believe the proposed districts remain competitive and that outcomes will ultimately depend on voter turnout and campaigning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The seats are competitive, but if you get out and work, you can win the seat,” she said. “But we’re not going to coronate you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the fate of the maps rests with the courts and, potentially, Virginia voters. </span></p>

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia House Democrats on Thursday muscled through a sweeping package of gun control legislation, passing more than half a dozen bills aimed at restricting access to certain firearms, tightening storage requirements and expanding civil liability for the gun industry, as Republicans — reduced to an even smaller minority after November’s elections — spoke forcefully in opposition but were ultimately unable to stop the measures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposals, which are now headed to the Senate, ranged from a ban on the sale of assault-style weapons and large-capacity magazines to new penalties for leaving visible handguns in unattended vehicles and requirements that firearms be locked in homes where children are present. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several of the votes, including passage of a high-profile assault weapons ban, were greeted with applause from spectators in the House gallery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans warned repeatedly that the legislation trampled constitutional rights and would invite costly legal challenges, while Democrats previously argued the bills were long-overdue public safety measures in a state that has repeatedly revisited gun policy in the wake of mass shootings and rising firearm deaths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Tom Garrett, R-Buckingham, delivered one of the most impassioned speeches of the day, framing the debate as a fundamental struggle between citizens and government power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garrett argued that the Second Amendment’s protections were broader than the text itself suggests, saying that if James Madison “wanted to be a little bit more wordy,” the amendment would have explicitly spelled out the right to defend against tyranny.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The government did not give me the right to defend myself, to defend my family, or to defend my freedom,” Garrett said, adding that the government “cannot take it away, try though it may.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garrett also criticized religious organizations that have backed gun control efforts, saying he was “absolutely awestruck” that a prominent Christian advocacy group supported some of the bills. “They must be reading a different Bible than me,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite those warnings, Democrats pressed ahead, buoyed by their majority and momentum from a revived gun safety agenda that has been building since last month, when Senate committees </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/27/virginia-senate-panel-advances-gun-safety-bills-once-vetoed-by-youngkin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advanced similar measures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> once vetoed by former Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most significant vote came on </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB217" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 217</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, which would prohibit the importation, sale, manufacture and transfer of assault firearms and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices. The bill passed 58-34.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the proposal, violations would be punishable as a Class 1 misdemeanor, with a three-year prohibition on purchasing, possessing or transporting firearms following a conviction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure exempts antique firearms, permanently inoperable guns, manually operated firearms such as bolt- or lever-action rifles, and weapons manufactured before July 1, 2026. It also bars individuals under 21 from possessing assault firearms, regardless of when they were made, with limited exceptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, said the bill “blatantly defies” U.S. Supreme Court precedent, particularly the court’s </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/supreme-court-ruling-creates-turmoil-over-gun-laws-in-lower-courts#:~:text=The%20Supreme%20Court's%20Bruen%20decision%20has%20changed,firearm%20restrictions%20can%20remain%20on%20the%20books." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 Bruen decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Calling the proposal “a lawyer’s dream,” Kilgore, himself a lawyer, predicted extensive litigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To call these rifles common is an understatement,” Kilgore said, arguing that the weapons and magazines targeted by the bill are widely owned and therefore constitutionally protected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He warned the law could backfire by producing a court ruling that explicitly protects both assault-style rifles and the magazines that feed them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another Helmer measure, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB21" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 21</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, passed 62-35 and would create new standards of “responsible conduct” for firearm industry members. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill allows the attorney general, local prosecutors or injured individuals to bring civil actions against manufacturers and sellers who fail to implement reasonable safeguards, including preventing straw purchases, theft and unlawful marketing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Jay Leftwich, R-Chesapeake, argued the bill conflicts with the federal </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/senate-bill/397/text" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and is dangerously vague. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the real goal was to choke off gun sales through “a tsunami of litigation” that would drive firearm businesses out of Virginia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats also passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB229" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 229</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by Del.

Katrina Callsen, D-Albemarle, narrowing exemptions for carrying firearms in state-owned buildings and on college campuses; and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB871" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 871</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by Del. Mark Downey, D-Williamsburg, requiring firearms to be locked in homes where minors or prohibited persons are present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opposing HB 871, Del. Eric Zehr, R-Campbell, said the bill failed to account for emergencies and could criminalize gun owners even if a minor used a firearm to save lives. “This bill is the embodiment of good intentions colliding with reality,” Zehr said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House also approved </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB40" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 40</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, targeting so-called ghost guns and plastic firearms, and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB93" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 93</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria, tightening rules around firearm transfers by individuals subject to protective orders. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB110" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 110</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by Del. Amy Laufer, D-Albemarle, would impose civil penalties for leaving visible handguns in unattended vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together, Thursday’s votes marked one of the most aggressive gun control pushes in the House in years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gun safety advocates praised the House action, calling it a turning point in Virginia’s approach to gun violence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia chapters of Moms Demand Action and Students Demand Action, part of Everytown for Gun Safety’s grassroots network, said passage of five priority bills reflects a broad effort to curb gun violence by banning assault-style weapons, cracking down on hard-to-trace ghost guns, holding the gun industry accountable and strengthening protections for survivors of domestic violence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a comprehensive commitment to protecting our children from gun violence in every form,” said Gayatri Manoharan, a volunteer with Moms Demand Action in Virginia, who credited lawmakers with responding to voter pressure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student advocates echoed that sentiment, with Prince William County Students Demand Action volunteer Aidan Vivas saying the votes showed what happens when elected leaders “prioritize our lives over the interests of the gun lobby,” and vowing continued advocacy until the bills reach Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s desk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Democrats controlling both legislative chambers and the governor’s office, the measures now move forward in a markedly different political climate than in prior sessions, when similar bills stalled or were vetoed by Youngkin.</span></p>

Abigail Spanberger made affordability the centerpiece of her 2026 agenda, promising relief for Virginians strained by high housing costs, rising energy bills and everyday expenses. But less than a month into the General Assembly session, </span><a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/virginia-democrat-leader-tax-increase-proposals-amazon-gun-gym-metro-affordability-scott-surovell-budget-surplus-economy-general-assembly-politics-conservative-liberal-dog-walking-tax-amazon-deliveries" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several dozen tax-increase bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed by Democratic lawmakers have given Republicans a ready-made political weapon — and an opening to portray the new governor as doing the opposite of what she promised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have seized on the proposals to mount an aggressive social media campaign casting Spanberger and legislative Democrats as eager to raise taxes and make life more expensive, despite the fact that the governor has neither endorsed the measures nor pledged to sign them — and most have yet to be taken up by committees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this week, Del. Joe McNamara, R-Roanoke County, a longtime ally of former Gov. Glenn Youngkin and a leading GOP voice on tax cuts, accused Democrats of breaking their affordability promises and embracing proposals he said would raise costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There were some really good bills — Democratic bills, Republican bills — that really made Virginia more affordable,” McNamara said. “We are living under this guise that Virginia is in these desperate financial straits. Virginia is not in desperate financial straits.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McNamara pointed to what he said were nearly $9 billion in budget surpluses over the past four years, alongside a similar amount in tax cuts, and said Youngkin left $2.7 billion for Virginians when he left office, which allowed for more tax cuts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He argued Democrats are moving in the other direction, pointing to bills that would create new income tax brackets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we look at where we are from the Democratic philosophies and bills that are coming forward, there are new tax brackets,” McNamara said. “There are 6%, or 8%, 10% tax brackets, and investment income tax brackets on the top.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He warned higher top rates could push wealthy residents out of Virginia and raise the state’s marginal tax burden. “This is kind of what the Democrat version of affordability is,” McNamara said. “The Republican version of affordability is very, very different.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McNamara also underscored GOP proposals to phase out the car tax, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB12" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">protect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the standard deduction </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB13" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and eliminate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the remaining 1% grocery tax — efforts he said Democrats routinely block.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have amplified those arguments online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, the official Virginia GOP account on X, formerly Twitter, </span><a href="https://x.com/va_gop/status/2018756302193995785?s=12&amp;t=uQxq3EX7p3bygcqVfUnstg" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “Waiting for any Democrat to explain how forcing moms and dads to pay 10% more to take their kids to Kings Dominion helps with affordability.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats say tax criticism ignores legislative reality</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic lawmakers say the criticism ignores both how the legislative process works and what has actually advanced so far this session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a joint news conference hosted by the nonprofit </span><a href="https://freedomva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freedom Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the state Capitol Tuesday, lawmakers promoting their affordability agenda found themselves repeatedly fielding questions about tax proposals that have not moved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a lot of noise out there about tax policy right now,” said Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, attributing the campaign to “disingenuous political actors.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, echoed that point, saying Republicans are cherry-picking bills that have not passed — or even been voted on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a selective narrative going on right now that’s not focused on the actual bills that are passing the legislature, which are focused extremely on affordability,” Helmer said. “The reality is, at the end of this session what we can promise every single Virginian is that the promises we made are promises we’re going to deliver.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helmer tied affordability pressures to broader economic forces, including federal policy, saying Virginians are struggling with housing, energy and grocery costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here in Virginia,” he said, “they’re going to have people that understand that the middle class, and every hardworking Virginian, is struggling to make ends meet right now.”</span></p>

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)<span style="font-size: 16px;">Democrats also argue the GOP narrative ignores a basic fact: the vast majority of tax-increase bills have not passed.</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Jessica Anderson, a Democratic freshman lawmaker from Williamsburg, addressed the issue directly in </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1EJ1fNAcMd/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Facebook video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There has been a lot of conversation happening on the mainstream media from my delegate colleagues on the other side of the aisle,” Anderson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And they’re really hyping up the bills that have been introduced by various delegates in the Democratic Party, and making this very wild assumption that the governor endorses every piece of policy that has been introduced, which is actually incorrect.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson noted she did not vet her own legislation with Spanberger before filing it, adding, “Technically, she wasn’t even the governor when I introduced them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She emphasized that individual lawmakers file bills based on district priorities, not party mandates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That does not mean that every bill that gets introduced, because it’s introduced by a Democrat, is going to get across the finish line,” Anderson said. “This assumption is so wild.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson’s video also played </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x27CHRKJLss" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a clip of President Donald Trump</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who last week accused Spanberger of raising taxes after taking office — a claim that is untrue because the legislature sets tax rates, not the governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Glenn was a friend of ours, and worked so hard on cutting taxes,” Trump said in the clip, referring to Youngkin. “This woman came in, and in one swoop, she raised everything up higher than it ever was.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger has not publicly responded to those remarks, and a spokesman for the governor declined to comment Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political scientist Stephen Farnsworth of the University of Mary Washington said that silence carries risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the things that we’ve learned in the world of social media is that the truth is a rare and not very highly valued commodity,” Farnsworth said. “You don’t need evidence to make a claim online, and increasingly, people don’t even care.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Farnsworth said allowing the narrative to linger could backfire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This story of Spanberger as a tax queen has been part of the conversation in Virginia for a week now, and silence is not in the governor’s interest,” he said. “Failing to respond to disinformation only increases the likelihood that there will be more and greater disinformation going forward.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Farnsworth noted that the scope of many tax proposals also matters in how voters perceive them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of the Democratic tax initiatives are very much aimed toward very specific slices of the electorate, and even if they pass, most voters may never feel them,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Spanberger has avoided weighing in on individual tax bills, her administration on Wednesday highlighted progress on the agenda </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/12/18/spanberger-makes-affordability-centerpiece-of-2026-agenda-as-legislative-session-nears/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">she rolled out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in December with Democratic leaders. Eight bills tied to the governor’s “Affordable Virginia Agenda” have already passed at least one chamber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those measures include legislation aimed at reducing </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">heating and energy costs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for low-income Virginians, establishing a statewide </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB3" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">weatherization task force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to improve home energy efficiency, empowering local governments to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preserve affordable housing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/30/democrats-try-to-balance-renters-rights-with-landlords-rights-in-proposed-housing-bills/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strengthening tenant protections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB220" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eliminating additional fees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on health insurance premiums. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers have also advanced </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB434" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to better utilize the existing electric grid to lower costs for ratepayers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My administration is focused on working with our partners in the General Assembly to lower healthcare, housing and energy costs for Virginians in every community across our commonwealth,” Spanberger said in a statement, adding that she looked forward to signing these bills, “and every piece of legislation in our agenda, into law to bring down costs for Virginians.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Many tax proposals remain pending</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By contrast, the tax-increase proposals Republicans cite remain stalled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among them is </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB900" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 900</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, which would lower the statewide sales tax rate from 4.3% to 4% while expanding the tax base to include certain services and digital goods starting in 2027. The bill also proposes regional transportation taxes and a 20-cent retail delivery fee in parts of Northern Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A similar proposal, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB978" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 978</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Vivian Watts, D-Fairfax, would tax a wide range of services — from fitness facilities to pet care — while exempting groceries and hygiene products from local sales taxes and directing new revenue toward schools and transportation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Sullivan’s bill, Watts’ proposal does not lower the base sales tax rate, meaning some consumers could see higher taxes depending on what they purchase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other bills include </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB188" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 188</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Kelly Convirs-Fowler, D-Virginia Beach, which would create a new 10% income tax bracket on earnings over $1 million, and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB979" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 979</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Watts, which pairs higher income tax brackets for high earners with a larger standard deduction and grocery tax exemptions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have also introduced </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB919" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taxes on firearms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ammunition and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB145" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fantasy sports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> operators, as well as a proposal to fund </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/29/va-lawmakers-try-again-on-paid-sick-leave-and-family-medical-leave-bills/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">paid family and medical leave</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through employer and employee premiums beginning in 2028. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All have been assigned to committees but remain pending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The car tax has long been one of the most politically potent issues in Virginia, with Republicans repeatedly promising its repeal during campaign season but falling short of eliminating it once in power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While GOP lawmakers have filed bills over the years aimed at scrapping the tax, former Gov. Glenn Youngkin did not include car tax repeal in the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/12/17/youngkin-pitches-final-budget-touts-strong-revenues-as-he-prepares-to-leave-office/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">final budget proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his administration rolled out in December.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McNamara, the Republican delegate from Roanoke County, argued the pattern has persisted regardless of who holds the governor’s mansion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Year after year, election time comes around, we talk about eliminating the car tax,” he said. “Year after year, after the election’s done, all the Republicans put forward bills to try to eliminate the dreaded car tax, and the Democrats kill those bills.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helmer disputed Republican claims that Democrats oppose eliminating the tax outright.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The stunning thing is actually we passed the beginning of the end to the car tax in Virginia,” he said, referring to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HJ34" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a resolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> introduced by Del. Lily Franklin, D-Montgomery, which directs the Department of Taxation to study options for abolishing the tax and identify alternative revenue sources for local governments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Democrats did that, and almost every single Republican … voted no. Without an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">alternative,” Helmer said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Franklin </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2023/10/13/two-virginia-democrats-embrace-a-former-republican-governors-signature-policy-eliminate-the-car-tax/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">had campaigned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for several years on repealing the car tax before defeating Republican Del. Chris Obenshain last fall. Once elected, however, she stopped short of calling for immediate elimination — a move Republicans have argued does not go far enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, only a handful of tax-related bills sponsored by Democrats have advanced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House last week passed legislation redistributing </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB341" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plastic bag tax revenue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to towns and authorized local referendums for </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB334" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">school construction sales taxes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At the same time, Democrats unanimously killed a proposed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB378" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">net investment income tax</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in subcommittee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the session continues, VanValkenburg said the final product — not social media posts or bill introductions — should define the debate over affordability versus tax hikes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When the session is over and the governor signs a budget,” he said, “I think you’re going to see a set of attached policies and a budget that reflects our values of helping the working and middle class Virginians and making life more affordable for them.”</span></p>

A jury in the civil case had awarded that amount against a former Richneck assistant principal in the 2023 attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys for the former assistant principal, Ebony Parker, could appeal. They contend the case should have been considered a worker’s compensation issue and</span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/newport-news/judge-upholds-10m-jury-award-for-nn-teacher-shot-by-first-grader/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that a teacher getting shot was among normal risks of the job</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonsense.</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/10/teachers-lawsuit-should-force-needed-re-examination-of-workers-comp-classroom-violence/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The incident was shocking and rare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, especially given the age of the shooter. Jurors ruled Parker failed to act decisively after she was told repeatedly that the first-grade boy had brought a gun to school that day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violent attacks against educators demand a re-examination of workers’ compensation guidelines in Virginia. State legislators passed the law originally in 1918 – more than a century ago – when violence in schools was far less.</span></p>
<p><b>Del. Alex Askew</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should rethink which windmills to tilt at – as well as his relationship with local officials – following his recent foray into an expensive public transit mode. The Virginia Beach Democrat had requested a state study about</span><a href="https://www.whro.org/local-government/2026-01-23/delegate-from-virginia-beach-seeks-study-of-extending-light-rail-to-the-oceanfront" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">extending the existing 7.4-mile light rail line from Norfolk to the Virginia Beach Oceanfront</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never mind that Virginia Beach voters</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2017/04/07/roger-chesley-finger-pointing-doesnt-fix-hrts-structural-problems/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">soundly rejected a partial extension in 2016</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of several times they weighed in. Never mind that a fixed rail line limits choices for travelers, or that The Tide system in Norfolk has been more a novelty than a way to entice motorists to leave their cars behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor did Askew reach out to Virginia Beach City Council members beforehand. “I was totally blindsided,” Mayor Bobby Dyer told me this week. That’s not good relationship-building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Askew, by email, said: “Since I have been in the General Assembly, I have not made it a practice to clear my legislation with city council. I remain in contact regarding the city&#8217;s legislative priorities with their representatives.” He should rethink that tack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A House Rules subcommittee</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/vote-details/HJ26/20261/H20001V2611282" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">killed his resolution Tuesday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Another of</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HJ28" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Askew’s resolutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, studying all public transit systems in Hampton Roads – including their capital funding – passed a subcommittee. However, I’ve seen no reports or comments suggesting a groundswell to revisit light rail in Virginia Beach.</span></p>
<p><b>All the machinations </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">regarding mid-decade redistricting in Virginia – including</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/27/virginia-court-strikes-down-redistricting-amendment-headed-for-april-ballot/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a circuit court judge recently shooting down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a nascent Democratic Party attempt – shouldn’t obscure this fact:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Donald J. Trump</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/08/08/repub/why-congressional-redistricting-is-blowing-up-across-the-us-this-summer/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">initiated this mess</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because his policies – destructive tariffs,</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/28/democrats-push-restrictions-on-federal-immigration-enforcement-in-virginia/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">harsh immigration enforcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/07/09/repub/on-the-fourth-of-july-trump-signs-his-big-beautiful-bill-into-law/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">gutting of Medicaid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to name a few – meant Republicans would get hammered during congressional contests this November under the 2024 maps. His actions are the very definition of rigging elections.</span></p>
<p><b>I also hope the</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> courts knock down the Trump administration’s much-ballyhooed criminal charges against journalists,</span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/read-the-full-indictment-against-don-lemon-georgia-fort-and-others-charged-in-minnesota" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">including Don Lemon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for doing their jobs. The crux of the federal indictment relates to the journalists’ coverage of an immigration protest at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Jan. 18. The prosecution could chill pursuit of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News alert: For years, reporters have covered activists without taking part in their protests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact Trump has beefed with Lemon’s coverage for years,</span><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/donald-trump-history-animosity-toward-103000832.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">dating to the reporter’s time at CNN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, reveals the true political motivation behind his arrest. </span></p>
<p><b>The late Sen. Yvonne Miller</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Norfolk Democrat</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2012/07/07/yvonne-miller-sought-office-for-all-the-right-reasons/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">who died in 2012</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, deserves the bouquets now coming her way. For years, she fought to make it easier for released felons to regain the right to vote in Virginia. Those efforts always failed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state Constitution vests restoration in the governor, making Virginia</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/01/27/deja-vu-moment-could-end-century-old-racist-doctrine-on-felon-enfranchisement/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">one of the toughest states in the nation in which felons could vote again</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after finishing their sentences.</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2016/05/02/roger-chesley-politics-cant-obscure-the-right-thing-to-do/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">That Constitution is rooted in racism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and dates to the start of the 20</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton,</span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2026-02-02/trailblazing-senators-work-on-voting-rights-praised" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">recognized Miller’s tireless efforts in paving the way for a constitutional amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Radio IQ reported this week</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Voters will finally get a chance in November to make Miller’s efforts a reality.</span></p>

<p><b>Visions of</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Australia came to mind</span><a href="https://www.wdbj7.com/2026/01/31/pet-kangaroo-safely-captured-roadway/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">when a news outlet reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Nelson County Sheriff’s deputies had found a kangaroo along a roadway over the weekend. Sheriff Mark Embrey told me that hunting dogs had gotten into the containment area where the marsupial lived and bit it. The kangaroo then fled by leaping over an 8-foot fence. (Wish there was video!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When reports of the wayward ’roo came in, deputies at first “did feel a practical joke was being played on them,” Embrey said. I wondered: Residents can keep these huge animals at their own homes? Crikey.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_46456" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:244px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-46456 size-medium" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Kangaroo-244x300.jpg" alt="" width="244" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Kangaroo-244x300.jpg 244w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Kangaroo-831x1024.jpg 831w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Kangaroo-768x946.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Kangaroo.jpg 919w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The wayward kangaroo, shown above, hopped several miles from its home before Nelson County Sheriff&#8217;s Office deputies recovered it.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embrey said the kangaroo lives with a couple who are both veterinarians. They reside in a farm-like setting over probably hundreds of acres. The two have special use permits for the animal, he said, adding the incident has “gotten national attention.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kangaroos are not listed as a non-native species that require a permit from the state Department of Wildlife Resources, a department spokesperson told me. Because the animal is privately owned, it doesn’t need an exhibition permit. </span></p>

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB636/text/SB636" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by outgoing Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, that would remove Confederate monuments from Virginia’s Capitol Square advanced in the state legislature Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statues depict General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, Gov. William “Extra Billy” Smith, and  Dr. Hunter Holmes McGuire; they were erected in the late 1800s and early 1900s, when laws disenfranchising Black Americans were enacted and memorials to the Confederacy were surfacing in public spaces like courthouses and other municipal buildings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson and Smith were prominent Confederate generals, and Smith went on to become governor of Virginia in the mid-1800s. McGuire, a </span><a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/12/16/va-has-hospital-named-slavery-supporting-confederate-doctor-and-it-wont-change-wilkie-says.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confederate doctor </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">during the Civil War, supported slavery and later opposed voting rights for Black people. A local Veterans Affairs hospital in Richmond that was previously named after him has since </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/richmond-va-medical-center-renamed-to-remove-confederate-commemoration/#:~:text=Richmond%20VA%20medical%20center%20renamed%20to%20remove%20Confederate%20commemoration,-by:%20Kassidy%20Hammond&amp;text=RICHMOND%2C%20Va.,to%20veterans'%20health%20care.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been renamed.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are not people we need to lionize,” Ebbin said during deliberation of the bill at the state Capitol Wednesday morning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ebbin’s bill directs the Department of General Services to remove and store the statues until the General Assembly can determine a final disposition for them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A substitute that was adopted in the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee on Wednesday also directs state agencies to develop options for final disposition of any other Confederate monuments or memorials that are in state government possession, which will be subject to review and approval by the  joint Rules committees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having cleared the Senate committee, Ebbin’s bill will need to pass in the Senate and eventually the House of Delegates before it has a chance to be potentially signed, amended or vetoed by Gov. Abigail Spanberger. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Confederate monuments and memorials have been removed around Virginia since a 2020 state law granted local governments the ability to relocate them. Some monuments in Charlottesville and Richmond garnered the most attention, with fierce debates and demonstrations both in support of and opposition to the objects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporters, including Groups like United Daughters of the Confederacy, headquartered in Richmond, said the statues represent a heritage of Southern pride and resistance to federal overreach. Detractors, including the Virginia State Conference NAACP and other civil rights groups, say the objects represent a legacy of racism, violence and intolerance while glorifying people who fought to preserve the enslavement of Black people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s movement to remove Confederate iconography can be traced back to 2016, when then-high school student Zyahna Bryant petitioned Charlottesville city council to take them down. By 2017, councilors Wes Bellamy and Kristen Szakos spearheaded a local ordinance to remove it from a local park.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That decision was then challenged in courts, as state law had not yet granted local governments such authority. In the summer of 2017, the Ku Klux Klan, far-right militia groups and Confederate groups rallied in the city, culminating in the deadly Unite the Right rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As 2020 demonstrations sparked nationwide following the death of George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, at the hands of police — calls for criminal justice reform and renewed efforts to remove symbols that venerated the Confederacy flared anew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2021 both </span><a href="https://www.cvilletomorrow.org/charlottesvilles-confederate-statues-removed/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charlottesville</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/09/08/with-confederates-vanquished-whats-next-for-richmonds-monument-avenue/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had removed most Confederate monuments from public spaces which had caught national attention. Charlottesville’s Jackson monument has since been reworked into a Los Angeles art installation, and a public input process is ongoing in Charlottesville to determine how to reuse the Lee statue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several other Confederate statues around Virginia were moved to historic battlefields or cemeteries and the city of Richmond’s Monument Avenue statues remain in </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2025-07-11/virginia-impacts-confederate-monuments-trump-stoney-martin-valentine" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">storage at a wastewater treatment facility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding the statues in Capitol Square, Ebbin said he added removing them to his to-do list after giving tours to constituents and feeling jarred by escorting people past them to statues that honor civil rights leaders and women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As he prepares to leave the state legislature and join Spanberger’s administration as senior advisor to the Cannabis Control Authority, he likened the attempt to remove them to the way people clean up a campsite before moving on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;d like to leave Capitol Square better than I found it,” Ebbin said. </span></p>

<p>In a show of regional unity, mayors from the seven core cities of Hampton Roads united to oppose a bill that would allow public workers to collectively bargain over wages, benefits, and working conditions without local governments’ approval.</p>
<p>Laquetta Mackey, president of the Norfolk Federation of Teachers, called it disappointing.</p>
<p>“We definitely need a seat at the table,” she said. “It should be a fundamental right.”</p>
<p>Virginia lawmakers in 2020 ended the decades-old prohibition on collective bargaining by state and local government workers, including school and public safety employees. That law gave local councils and school boards the final say on bargaining with unions.</p>
<p>Bills moving through committees in the General Assembly, however, would remove that power from localities. If signed into law, Virginia would create a state-level public employee relations board to oversee the process and arbitrate disputes.</p>
<p>The bills could shrink Virginia’s public-sector pay gap, which is among the largest in the U.S., according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute; public employees in Virginia make more than 25% less than private-sector workers with similar schooling and backgrounds. The<a class="Link" href="https://www.epi.org/publication/stronger-collective-bargaining-laws-will-benefit-all-virginians/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u> EPI’s report, published in January</u></a>, found closing the pay gap could also lead to better public services, less turnover and improved racial and gender pay gaps.</p>
<p>Hampton Roads mayors, though, wrote<a class="Link" href="https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/625613422_1298398085432075_6816341270350612376_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s640x640_tt6&amp;_nc_cat=101&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=127cfc&amp;_nc_ohc=9su6ql57dIAQ7kNvwHNr-1e&amp;_nc_oc=Adnxk9-mxv-MlMifMtyO4rksoDBzZoiu1XKFwARMfun2PPy41t661-PTmBqE2h85fzg&amp;_nc_zt=23&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.xx&amp;_nc_gid=l9ra-3y2_2jHFXoe5b4x5A&amp;oh=00_AftarXPSqyK1LFcyyWLg285Dcf9yJ0yUvgjypE6BKKTezg&amp;oe=698854F9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u> in a letter</u></a> that local governments know their localities’ finances, service needs and workforce priorities best.</p>
<p>“While our individual governing bodies hold varying perspectives on collective bargaining, we are united in one fundamental principle: local decision-making is essential,” read the letter penned by the mayors of Norfolk, Suffolk, Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, Portsmouth, Hampton and Newport News.</p>
<p>In 2023, Portsmouth voted to authorize collective bargaining but hasn&#8217;t implemented the practice. Newport News’ collective bargaining task force in 2025 recommended five bargaining units, but council hasn&#8217;t voted to establish them. Norfolk and <a class="Link" href="https://www.whro.org/2024-04-09/virginia-beach-firefighters-ems-rally-for-bargaining-rights-at-council-hearing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Virginia Beach rejected collective bargaining efforts</u></a> in recent years.</p>
<p>Union leaders such as Mackey see that as a testament to why state action is necessary. She believes workers should be able to decide whether they want to collectively bargain, not local officials.</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t matter what zip code you live in,” Mackey said. “Working conditions are important, we should be able to bargain for that; we should be able to bargain for safety policies, benefits.”</p>

Abigail Spanberger announces an executive order ending agreements between state law enforcement agencies and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. (Photo by Shannon Heckt/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Abigail Spanberger has formally ended an agreement with the U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement that had allowed Virginia State Police troopers and Virginia Department of Corrections officers to assist ICE. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agreement — which stems from Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration —  had effectively placed state law enforcement under federal control and supervision to conduct civil immigration enforcement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ending the agreements was a campaign promise of Spanberger’s last year when she said tasking state and local law enforcement to help with federal law enforcement was a “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/08/27/spanberger-vows-to-scrap-youngkins-immigration-order-if-elected-governor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">misuse of those resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said she’d rather law enforcement focus on its core duties than serve as deputies to ICE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 12 builds on her earlier </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/17/spanberger-sworn-in-as-virginias-first-woman-governor-moves-swiftly-to-set-agenda/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">day-one executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that gave her the option to end the agreement that Order 12 now rescinds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order directs all state law enforcement agencies to review policies, training and practices to ensure they align with standards of protecting human life and to “not engage in fear-based policing, enforcement theater, or actions that create barriers to people seeking assistance in their time of need.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger pointed to national conversations around ICE’s tactics in a meeting with the news media on Wednesday. As President Donald Trump’s administration has had the agency hyper-focused on Minneapolis in recent weeks, American citizens like </span><a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2026/01/21/renee-good-shot-in-left-temple-per-independent-autopsy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renee Good</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2026/01/30/department-of-justice-opens-civil-rights-investigation-into-killing-of-alex-pretti/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex Pretti</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been killed by agents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it has brought the conversation to the forefront,” Spanberger said of how their deaths helped inspire her new order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drawing on her own background in law enforcement, she emphasized that the order is intended to reinforce accountability, public service, and safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s extraordinarily important to make sure that we are celebrating, and honoring and recognizing the strong vetting, the strong training, and the incredibly high standards that here in the commonwealth of Virginia, we hold our law enforcement agencies to,” Spanberger said. “We want to make sure that we’re making a clear line in the sand about what is expected of our law enforcement officials.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans, however, offered a sharply different view. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Glenn Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield said in reaction Wednesday that he believes the order reflects Spanberger “putting politics over public safety.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/03/foia-friday-records-reveal-surge-in-ice-arrests-across-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of late last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the majority of the thousands of people detained by ICE in Virginia had no criminal histories. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Virignia’s legislature and governorship now under Democratic control — at a time when  President Donald Trump has targeted Democratic-led states — immigration advocates and civil rights groups </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/26/in-newly-democratic-virginia-immigration-enforcement-becomes-early-test-for-spanberger/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have argued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the commonwealth could become the next focal point for ICE enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Republican lawmakers have suggested Trump could retaliate against Virginia over Spanberger’s actions. Del. Karen Hamilton, R-Culpeper, speculated in a recent social media post that the president could </span><a href="https://x.com/KarenHamiltonVA/status/2012886837082165325" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">withhold federal funding </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">following Spanberger’s previous ICE-related order — a move </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-wants-to-restrict-funding-for-localities-that-dont-comply-with-immigration-enforcement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin once threatened</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against localities that declined to cooperate with ICE. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked Wednesday whether he believes Trump might retaliate, Sturtevant said, “we’ll see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At the end of the day,” he added, “we know we have criminal illegal aliens here in Virginia. We have federal law enforcement, whose job it is to go and identify, find, and deport these individuals. We had been working constructively with those federal partners to do that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger, meanwhile, said her order does not prohibit cooperation between state agencies and ICE under limited circumstances, such as participation in special task forces or when ICE presents  judicial warrants requesting assistance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s a clear delineation,” she said. “But taking Virginia law enforcement, state agency personnel, and basically giving them over to ICE, is something that ends today.”</span></p>

Richard Stuart. (Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/11/24/virginia-communities-push-back-against-sewage-sludge-on-agricultural-land-as-pfas-concerns-grow/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growing concern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the presence of “forever chemicals,” per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), in municipal waste has prompted a slew of bills that are now under review in the Virginia General Assembly session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That waste is often turned into a sludge called biosolids, which is then used as fertilizer on farms across the commonwealth. The state doesn’t test the biosolids for PFAS before it is spread on farms by specially permitted companies.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB386" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 386</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sponsored by Sen. Richard Stuart, R-King George, would effectively ban the use of biosolids if there is any presence of PFAS in them. Forever chemicals present in everyday products like cookware, water resistant clothing, fast food packaging and industrial runoff can leech into the wastewater and become concentrated in biosolids.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would also levy a penalty via fines on any company that spreads biosolids containing PFAS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synagro, a company that provides biosolids to Virginia farmers, has previously expressed  concerns about PFAS and supported potential legislation to remove the chemicals at the source or to implement discharge limitations for manufacturers to stop it from ending up in wastewater.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Synagro is a passive receiver of PFAS from municipalities, who themselves are passive receivers from their customers,” a company spokesperson </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/11/24/virginia-communities-push-back-against-sewage-sludge-on-agricultural-land-as-pfas-concerns-grow/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in November. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stuart said Tuesday his constituents have been testing their well water and have found PFAS present. While they can’t directly blame the biosolids for putting them in their water, biosolids being spread on the surrounding farms does pique fears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The only thing I know is to stop applying it with the PFAS in it, or whatever level the experts think is appropriate,” Stuart said. “This bill represents the right answer for human health and for the environment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maryland recently lowered their threshold for the presence of PFAS in biosolids to 100 parts per billion; after that point, officials recommend the spreading be stopped. Stuart said the neighboring state’s new policy could mean more of the municipal waste will be shipped to Virginia to be used as biosolids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand that zero tolerance is a lot,” Stuart said. “I know that there is a percentage somewhere that people may be able to live with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents for the bill said that a zero tolerance is warranted due to the risks PFAS pose to human health. Some of the </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/news-info/shortcuts/topics-of-interest/per-and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">potential dangers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include an increased risk of certain cancers, heightened cholesterol and lower pregnancy rates, according to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The question that the body is wrestling with in all of these vehicles is how much is safe,” said Jay Ford with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. “Sen. Stuart’s bill is right. He&#8217;s correct on the number. It&#8217;s zero.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other states such as Maine have banned the use of biosolids completely, and Connecticut has banned the use of biosolids that have traces of PFAS in them. Three other states have enacted reporting requirements for PFAS in biosolids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple bills have been filed that reflect a range of efforts to test the biosolids and for wastewater treatment facilities to test for the presence of PFAS. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB880" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 880</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has not yet had a hearing, requires sewage treatment facilities to test for PFAS once a month. Another bill, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB138" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB138</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, requires the testing be done each quarter of a year; if PFAS is found, then the testing would be allowed to be extended.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those bills are similar to 2024</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/25/virginia-water-regulators-begin-process-of-identifying-pfas-sources/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that tasked water regulators with locating the source of major PFAS in drinking water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You&#8217;ll hear about those bills that other members of the General Assembly are carrying,” Stuart said. “The problem is they don&#8217;t do anything, and we&#8217;ve got to do something. We can&#8217;t continue with this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But not everyone is on board with his bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Farm Bureau opposed the bill because biosolids are significantly cheaper fertilizer compared to synthetic fertilizers. If biosolids were to be banned, it would create a major cost to farmers, representatives of the Bureau said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Municipal Drinking Water Association spoke against it because biosolids are a key use for leftover sludge after wastewater is treated. They pointed out that landfills don’t want the sludge  and incinerating it creates toxic emissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most communities around the Commonwealth rely on this practice for handling the solids that result from the clean water treatment process,” said Chris Pomeroy, counsel for the association. “We agree with the notion of reducing PFAS, and we&#8217;re here to help.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill advanced out of the subcommittee on Tuesday with a promise from lawmakers to work on finding a compromise to prevent outright banning biosolids, and determining an acceptable percentage of PFAS in biosolids that farmers, localities and others can agree to. The bill now moves on to the full Senate agriculture committee.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group, as well as a coalition of criminal justice reform organizations, probation officers, prosecutors, defense attorneys and victims’ advocates, helped develop the new proposal, which would allow formerly incarcerated people to be released from probation after a year if they demonstrate their rehabilitation by meeting certain benchmarks laid out by their probation officer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A version by Sen. Christine New Craig, R-Chesapeake, already </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB136" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">passed the Senate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and on Tuesday, House Bill 149 by Del. Wren Williams, R-Patrick, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB149" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cleared the House of Delegates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benchmarks could include maintaining stable housing and employment, obtaining health insurance, earning vocational certifications or participating in mental health or substance use treatment programs as needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year’s bill was more prescriptive in the criteria while this year’s bill will allow a case-by- case process for people and their probation officers, who can then send a letter to courts to end the probation status. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal is backed by Reform Alliance, a national criminal justice organization that was founded by rappers Jay Z, Meek Mill and others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a common sense improvement to the Commonwealth’s probation system that applies best practices that reduce crime, lighten heavy probation caseloads, and increase reentry success,” Reform Alliance said in a statement on Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia-based criminal justice organizations including Nolef Turns and The Humanization Project have supported the bill. The Virginia Interfaith Center For Public Policy has backed the measure, as well as conservative-leaning Americans For Prosperity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When carrying the bill last year Williams emphasized that the bipartisan drive for reform is “recognition that the punitive approach has not worked.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that he believes earned probation reductions can help formerly incarcerated people “rebuild their lives out of the American Dream” and contribute to safer communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenneth Hunter, an organizer with Virginia Interfaith, also noted how probation status can sometimes hinder people that are trying to get their life back on track. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The travel restrictions that probation terms typically come with can hamper employment, Hunter said. He said he hears that commercial truck drivers run into this problem, particularly around the North Carolina state border depending on their routes. The limitations can prevent truckers from obtaining certain jobs or stunt their growth within their jobs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people have also told The Mercury they believe their probation status has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/23/these-virginians-wont-be-able-to-vote-next-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been a factor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the rejection of their voter rights restoration requests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike other states, in Virginia, governors decide if formerly incarcerated people’s voting rights will be restored. Former Gov. Glenn Youngkin had lower restorations than previous governors and his administration offered little clarity on factors that contributed to the success or rejection of requests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A pending </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/14/virginia-house-democrats-advance-four-constitutional-amendments-on-opening-day-of-2026-session/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">constitutional amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could make restorations automatic so long as someone has finished their prison sentences, if a majority of Virginians approve a ballot referendum later this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No bills have made their way to Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s desk yet, so the jury is still out on whether the parole reform bill stands a chance to become law this year. She could approve the bill as-is, seek adjustments to it, or veto it outright. </span></p>

(Photo courtesy of Randy Chambers)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The northern diamondback terrapin is one of Virginia’s species in greatest need of protection, conservation groups say. But a bill that’s working through the state legislature to reduce the number of the terrapins that drown in Chesapeake Bay crab pots met pushback this week from fishermen who say it could impede their trade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dozens of Virginia watermen traveled to Richmond Monday to voice their concerns about </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1013" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1013</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would have required bycatch reduction devices on crab pots in designated areas of the Bay. The devices are meant to prevent the terrapin from getting inside while still allowing crabs to enter the pots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re not targeted by crabbers by any means. They just frequently get trapped in crab pots and cannot escape. They will drown in about 50 minutes,” bill sponsor Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bycatch devices — plastic borders on the opening of crab pots to make them smaller — preventing the turtles from entering the pots. However, the watermen said it also blocks  larger crabs from getting into the pots. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some bill opponents stated that pots with these devices see as much as a 50% cut to their catch. Commercial watermen argued the bill was unnecessary since they check their pots every day, which helps reduce the number of terrapins that get trapped in their pots, unlike recreational pots that are often left in the water for days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being forced to add bycatch devices could ultimately impact their bottom line, they said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With this small volume of product, high prices will come to it,” said J.C. Hudgins, President of the Virginia Waterman Association. “It will eventually cause these regional seafood dealers to go elsewhere.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diamondback terrapins inhabit the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and have experienced a 75% population drop over the last 50 years, according to the Center for Biological Diversity. The center </span><a href="https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/virginia-petition-seeks-to-protect-diamondback-terrapins-from-drowning-in-crab-traps-2025-02-12/?_gl=1*br85n2*_gcl_au*MTUwMTE5NDg5Mi4xNzY4NDk4OTI1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">petitioned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Virginia Marine Resources Commission in 2024 to create regulations to protect the terrapins from getting caught in the crab pots. There have also been multiple, unsuccessful attempts to place the reptile on the federal endangered or threatened species lists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Rob Bloxom, R-Accomack, said the statistics aren’t reliable because it has been decades since a formal study has been done about the diamondback terrapins in the Chesapeake Bay region. He said he believes their population decline is due to factors beyond just crab pot drownings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation was amended on Monday in the House Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources Committee to only apply to recreational pots. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The areas where the recreational pots are frequently used are closer to shore, where the terrapins go to lay their eggs. The bill also requires the Marine Resources Commission and Virginia Institute of Marine Science to spend the next two years studying locations in the Bay where the terrapins are most threatened to potentially apply the restriction to commercial pots in those areas, too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This isn’t a stagnant picture. It&#8217;s not like we’re in one spot all year long,” said Robert Whitman, a commercial fisherman speaking against the bill. “If we had these management areas we might move into it for two weeks and then come out we have to put an excluder on and take it back off. The volume of work and money that would entail is just unfathomable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloxom argued that the language of the bill suggests that in two years once the study by the two agencies are completed, the restrictions to commercial crab pots will be all but certain to be implemented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we’re looking at is a path forward to reduce mortality in recreational fisheries,” said Chris Moore, Director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. “Then we can look at other mortalities with all the experts in the room.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tran agreed to continue to work on the language of the bill to make its study portion more open ended, with a focus on the protection areas and finding ways to better protect the terrapins. The bill will then be heard before the full House Agriculture committee.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Details of the now-stopped sale first came to light last week, against the backdrop of a broader push by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to expand immigration detention capacity in Virginia — including controversial proposals in Hanover and Stafford counties.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0151-scaled.jpg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jan. 16 memo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> obtained by The Mercury, Youngkin instructed the Virginia Department of General Services, which oversees the sale of state-owned property, to proceed with selecting Moxie Asset Group, LLC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the buyer for the prison complex in rural Augusta County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Ltr-re-Augusta-Correctional-Center-1.28.26.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">directive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, issued less than two weeks after she took office, formally withdrew that order and reopened the decision-making process — a move that comes as the former prison has emerged in public debate over potential new immigration detention facilities in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Monday, the property </span><a href="https://property.jll.com/listings/former-augusta-correctional-center-1821-estaline-valley-rd-not-tracked-virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remained listed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for sale by Jones Lang LaSalle.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">From full capacity to closure</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owned and operated by the Virginia Department of Corrections in Craigsville, the Augusta Correctional Center opened in 1986 and for decades housed up to 1,222 inmates at a Level 3 security classification. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prisoners were required to maintain two years without disciplinary infractions to be eligible for transfer to a less secure facility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December 2023, </span><a href="https://vadoc.virginia.gov/news-press-releases/2023/virginia-department-of-corrections-announces-closure-of-four-facilities-to-enhance-public-safety/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VADOC announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Augusta would permanently close, alongside three other state prisons, effective July 1, 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency cited persistent staffing shortages, rising overtime costs and concerns about employee safety. According to VADOC, more than $1 million a year was being spent on overtime at Augusta alone, and as of January 2024 — months before its closure — the prison’s population had dropped to 489 inmates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to shut down the facility sent </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/02/13/planned-prison-closure-puts-the-squeeze-on-a-small-town-in-augusta-county/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">economic shockwaves</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through the surrounding community, where the prison had long been one of the region’s largest employers. Local officials warned at the time that the loss of hundreds of jobs would reverberate through Augusta County’s tax base, schools and small businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his memo to DGS Director Banci Tewolde, Youngkin said the proposed sale of the prison followed a competitive process and complied with state law and legislative authority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wrote that the administration sought informal guidance from members of the Joint Money Committees, who declined to provide written comments and “indicated that they had no notable concerns with proceeding under the authority granted by the General Assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The memo made no reference to the prison’s potential future use, including whether it could be repurposed as an immigration detention facility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin said DGS evaluated multiple offers and concluded that Moxie Asset Group’s $3.25 million bid “represented the best outcome for the commonwealth,” citing its higher price, fewer contingencies and lack of financing risk compared with other proposals, which he said were lower in value or carried greater execution risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He directed DGS to proceed with selecting Moxie’s offer and to coordinate with the Office of the Attorney General to complete the transaction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury has filed a Freedom of Information Act request with DGS seeking all correspondence, records and communications related to the marketing, bidding, evaluation and proposed sale of the Augusta Correctional Center, including any contacts with prospective buyers or other state and federal agencies.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Spanberger pulls the plug</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger moved quickly to undo the directive after taking office, ordering DGS to halt any action taken under Youngkin’s instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Any directives previously issued by the Office of the Governor to the Department of General Services related to the sale of the Augusta Correctional Center and related property are hereby withdrawn and should not be followed,” Spanberger wrote in a memo to Tewolde last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added: “Given the existing comprehensive and competitive bidding process that resulted in multiple officers for the property, I hereby direct the Department of General Services to promptly review all received offers and and provide a recommendation for a sale in a manner consistent with” Virginia law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokeswoman for Spanberger declined to comment further for this story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responding to an email from The Mercury, an ICE spokesperson said the agency had “no new detention centers to announce at this time,” while emphasizing that it is continuing to expand detention capacity nationwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement added that DHS continues to conduct law enforcement activities across the country and that “it should not come as news that ICE will be making arrests in states across the U.S. and is actively working to expand detention space.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It remains unclear whether there is any connection between Moxie and the Department of Homeland Security or its immigration enforcement arm, Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Attempts to reach the company continue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local officials in Augusta County emphasized that they oppose the use of the former prison as an ICE facility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an email to The Mercury, Augusta County Administrator Timothy Fitzgerald said, “The Augusta County Board of Supervisors has made it clear that they do not support an ICE facility at this location.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Augusta County understands that several proposals for the Augusta correctional property were previously presented to Governor Youngkin’s office for consideration, some of which include options for ICE detention facilities,” Fitzgerald wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is our understanding that these proposals have been transitioned to the Virginia Department of General Services (DGS) for the selection of a proposal for final negotiations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Augusta County, he concluded, “has been in communication with DGS to share our position regarding the sale of the property.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The controversy in Augusta echoes a recent fight in Hanover County, where the local Board of Supervisors last week </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/29/not-the-right-location-hanover-supervisors-residents-oppose-dhs-ice-facility/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced its opposition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ICE’s proposal to open a detention center in a privately owned warehouse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement followed days of public backlash and a single, packed public meeting that drew widespread attention and opposition from residents and immigrant rights advocates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the mounting backlash, the building’s owner </span><a href="https://www.12onyourside.com/2026/01/30/company-withdraws-plan-sell-building-dhs-ice-facility/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">withdrew plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to sell the warehouse to ICE, effectively halting the proposal.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">ACLU documents put spotlight on Augusta</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plans for the Augusta Correctional Center first surfaced publicly last week through new documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union, along with the ACLU of Virginia and the ACLU of North Carolina. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The records reveal that ICE is considering </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-ice-actively-considering-opening-six-new-immigration-detention-centers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">six new locations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nationwide for potential detention centers — including Augusta Correctional Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.aclu.org/documents/foia-response-washington-field-office-detention-expansion" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">98 pages of records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were disclosed in response to </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/cases/aclu-foundation-v-ice/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed by the ACLU and its affiliates in October 2025, after ICE failed to respond to a Freedom of Information Act request. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The litigation is part of a broader series of lawsuits seeking details about ICE’s plans to expand detention capacity across the Midwest, South and West Coast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the heavily redacted documents, the Augusta proposal notes that the detention center is “in discussions with a private operator to run the facility,” which is not named. The ACLU said people held at the facility previously endured sexual assault and that former officers pleaded guilty to smuggling drugs into the prison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disclosures came less than a month after The Washington Post </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/12/24/ice-immigrants-detention-warehouses-deportation-trump/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that President Donald Trump’s administration is planning to convert industrial warehouses into large-scale ICE detention facilities capable of holding more than 80,000 people at a time — which ICE denied in the statement emailed to The Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These will not be warehouses — they will be very well-structured detention facilities meeting our regular detention standards,” the ICE spokesperson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sophia Gregg, senior immigrants’ rights attorney with the ACLU of Virginia, said the organization pursued the records because of what they view as a dangerous and opaque expansion of immigration detention — particularly in Virginia, which already hosts two large ICE facilities in Farmville and Caroline County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s important that the public knows that ICE is continuing to expand detention across the country, and especially in Virginia,” Gregg said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Any detention center that has capacity like the Augusta facility, or others, would dramatically increase the tension here in Virginia, which would have just really devastating effects on the communities that they would be put in, and to the people that would be impacted, who could be detained there,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gregg pointed to </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2026/jan/04/ice-2025-deaths-timeline" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rising deaths</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in ICE custody, alleging systemic failures in medical care and oversight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we do know about immigration detention in the last year is that it has had more deaths in ICE custody than in two decades, and there’s been six recorded deaths so far in this year alone,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also cited reports that ICE has </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/atlanta/news/ice-stopped-paying-for-detainee-medical-care-as-population-surged/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stopped paying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> medical providers as detainee populations surged, and that oversight mechanisms within DHS have been dismantled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are deadly detention centers that are being expanded exponentially across the country, in secret, and no community wants them there,” Gregg said. “They are a blight on any community, and in Virginia, there’s no need for any new detention facilities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.cygn.al/polls/national-poll-deportation-ice-overwhelmingly-supported-by-voters-and-democrats-pay-a-political-price-on-the-issue-especially-over-a-shutdown/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Republican polling firm Cygnal, released by the White House Monday, found majority support for several core aspects of federal immigration enforcement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the poll, 73% of respondents said entering the United States without authorization is breaking the law, 61% said they support deporting people who are in the country illegally to their home countries, 58% said they oppose efforts to defund Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and 54% said they support ICE enforcing federal immigration laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, a </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-trump-greenland-trump-poll/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBS News/YouGov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> poll conducted Jan. 14-16 found public sentiment toward Immigration and Customs Enforcement shifting in the opposite direction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey found that about 61% of Americans said ICE’s operations are “too tough” when stopping and detaining people, and roughly half said they believe the agency is not prioritizing serious criminals but instead targeting broader groups of people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poll also found that a majority viewed ICE as making communities where it operates less safe, with 52% saying so compared with 31% who said operations make communities safer. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Lawmakers enter the fray</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns over detention expansion reached Capitol Hill last week, when U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, led Virginia’s House Democrats in </span><a href="https://mcclellan.house.gov/media/press-releases/mcclellan-leads-virginia-house-democrats-oppose-proposed-ice-facilities" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sending a letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons opposing planned ICE facilities in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since early last year, we have witnessed an increasingly aggressive and militant ICE under your leadership,” the members wrote. “Most recently in Minneapolis, we have seen federal immigration agents kill two American citizens, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, and injure dozens more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the nation, “there have been reports of overcrowded detention facilities with poor ventilation, inadequate climate control, limited access to shower facilities and basic hygiene, and insufficient food and access to meals,” the letter continued, citing conditions reported at ICE’s Washington Field Office in Chantilly last summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We do not want the commonwealth to be home to large detention facilities rejected by our local communities, which make no one safer,” the lawmakers wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rather, these facilities undermine public safety, erode trust between local law enforcement and the public, and place a federal agency indifferent to constitutional liberties near our schools, hospitals, and residential areas.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the fate of the Augusta Correctional Center remains unresolved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger’s decision to rescind Youngkin’s directive has paused the sale and reopened scrutiny of how the state disposes of former prisons — particularly when those properties could be repurposed for controversial federal uses.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">RICHMOND, Va. &#8212; Virginia lawmakers want to remove toxic chemicals from cosmetics to better protect public health, something advocates say is also better for the environment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Karen Keys-Gamarra, D-Fairfax, introduced the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB122/text/HB122" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB122/text/HB122&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1770144369230000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0K8-9kySkgUMb-N-ITCIyk">Humane and Toxin-Free Cosmetics Act</a>, or House Bill 122. The proposal updates the Virginia Consumer Protection Act to ban use of certain chemicals such as formaldehyde and methylene glycol, among others.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Formaldehyde is known to induce contact dermatitis, a form of eczema, according to the National Health Service. It is found in preservatives that release formaldehyde through activation by water. Shampoos and creams are a common carrier, according to the National Library of Medicine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Formaldehyde, at high levels or prolonged exposure, is also considered a human carcinogen, according to the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-products/hair-smoothing-products-release-formaldehyde-when-heated" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-products/hair-smoothing-products-release-formaldehyde-when-heated&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1770144369230000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0V41CaH3WuoR9hEuV-d72k">Food and Drug Administration</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Methylene glycol is a liquid form of formaldehyde found in hair smoothing products. When the hair smoothing solution is heated, formaldehyde is released into the air as a gas. Formaldehyde, when airborne, can cause irritation to the eyes, nose and lungs, according to the FDA.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> Keys-Gamarra was inspired to introduce the measure because of a National Conference of State Legislatures training. The toxins have been a focus in bills introduced in other states. She noted concern regarding products for perms and lipstick.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I know perms, lipsticks … we don’t even know what’s in there and there’s no real way to know unless you do a lot of research and that&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re doing when you go to CVS,” Keys-Gamarra said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The chemicals have a human impact, according to Keys-Gamarra.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I am aware, for example, with chemicals used for Black women and other women, there are chemicals in there that can cause cancer, that can cause other health problems and it’s treated as though it&#8217;s a cost of business,” Keys-Gamarra said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Autumn Carter owns Red Salon Organics in Richmond. She was inspired to create an environmentally-friendly salon after being diagnosed with autoimmune issues. She researched potential causes of the autoimmune concerns and the environmental and bodily impacts of daily items she was around, according to Carter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I just started researching it in my own personal life and then I was like: ‘Well, wait a minute, what am I inhaling at work?’” Carter said. “What is going into my skin and being absorbed into my bloodstream?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Carter decided that she wanted an environmentally-conscious salon that would also prioritize safety of her guests. The salon does not use any product with formaldehyde.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Carter hopes to see more regulation in cosmetics of any carcinogenic product that causes harm to people and the environment. Unlike Europe, the U.S. cosmetic and hair industry is not really FDA controlled, she said. She used Brazilian blowouts as an example and said a certain ventilation system is often needed to <a href="https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-products/hair-smoothing-products-release-formaldehyde-when-heated#:~:text=Hair%20smoothing%20products%20are%20used,of%20inhaling%20the%20released%20formaldehyde." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-products/hair-smoothing-products-release-formaldehyde-when-heated%23:~:text%3DHair%2520smoothing%2520products%2520are%2520used,of%2520inhaling%2520the%2520released%2520formaldehyde.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1770144369230000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qgZjAQHXE8gTkGUonUPjx">offset chemical exposure</a>, but only a small number of salons have those in place.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There&#8217;s no real regulation, or people kind of overseeing, to make sure that these things are safe for us to be inhaling and for us to have absorbed into our skin and our bloodstream,” Carter said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetics-laws-regulations/fda-authority-over-cosmetics-how-cosmetics-are-not-fda-approved-are-fda-regulated" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetics-laws-regulations/fda-authority-over-cosmetics-how-cosmetics-are-not-fda-approved-are-fda-regulated&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1770144369230000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0kgVnkRuoOR_gHWrbyrdE7">does not require</a> cosmetics and ingredients, besides color additives, to have FDA approval before going on the market. The products must follow laws and regulations regarding interstate commerce, according to the FDA. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulates workplace safety in regards to exposure to identified hazardous chemicals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Carter works with a retired nurse practitioner, whose focus is women&#8217;s health, to determine the impact and use of products. There are some items that are completely unavoidable, but her decisions include the type and percentage used in a product and its impact on people and the environment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Keys-Gamarra’s bill was assigned to the House Housing/Consumer Protection subcommittee, but has not been heard yet. Del. Rae Cousins, D-Richmond, introduced <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB864" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB864&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1770144369230000&amp;usg=AOvVaw331-UGy1lBtiYt1Jx3IDAH">House Bill 864</a>, a similar piece of legislation that also remains in the subcommittee.</p>

Since then, the subsidiary has invested little in Norfolk.

Some City Council members are losing patience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report reveals HRV funded $8 million in tax credits for </span><a href="https://www.biltwisenm.com/new-page-4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biltwise Modular Structures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Roswell, New Mexico, expansion of a South Carolina company, and invested $7 million in the </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=100984236292412&amp;set=pb.100091425061584.-2207520000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southeast Texas Food Bank and Resource Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Jasper during 2024.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Two years after council push for local investment, Hampton Roads Ventures has yet to deliver&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/01/02/two-years-after-council-push-for-local-investment-hampton-roads-ventures-has-yet-to-deliver/embed/#?secret=veGbCSbpds#?secret=HTHSvFHx7Y" data-secret="HTHSvFHx7Y" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies like Hampton Roads Ventures are called community development entities. They may be offshoots of banks, nonprofits, public agencies, or other financial institutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They apply for </span><a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/103995/where-do-new-markets-tax-credit-projects-go_0.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Markets Tax Credits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and, if they prevail in the highly competitive process, they match projects and investors who earn a 39% tax break over seven years.  The program&#8217;s intent is to spur investment in distressed areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HRV is an unusual development entity created by a locality that has not focused on backing local projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report does not make clear what efforts were made to invest in Norfolk or the region. Sean Washington, Norfolk&#8217;s director of economic development, said he met with HRV representatives twice in 2025. He did not reply to a request for details of those meetings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The January Treasury Department </span><a href="https://www.cdfifund.gov/media/8018331/download?inline" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report on community development entities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows HRV has $30.5 million in tax credits issued in 2022 and 2023 available to attract investors. It is possible some of that has been committed to projects not completed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayor Kenneth Alexander did not answer emails or phone messages seeking comment, but four members of the city council said they want to know more about the corporation&#8217;s efforts. One pushed for changes in its operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I continue to be disappointed in the lack of significant investment in Norfolk,&#8221; Council member Courtney Doyle said after reviewing the report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carlos Clanton, a new member of the council, said there should be a meeting with HRV. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My focus is on accountability, transparency, and constructive engagement to ensure these opportunities translate into real benefits for Norfolk residents,” Clanton said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Council member Tommy Smigiel noted the need for a grocery store downtown and perhaps one in his ward in Ocean View, and a planned new warehouse for the Foodbank of Southeastern Virginia and the Eastern Shore, the kind of </span><a href="https://hamptonroadsventures.com/portfolio/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projects HRV has funded in other states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also wondered why there was no reporting about exploring local projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Something like that would have shown some kind of effort at a minimum,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to figure out as a council and a city how we want to better utilize them and work as partners to our advantage.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy McGee, a new council member who met with HRV officials early in 2025, noted that they claimed a need to focus on certain industries and businesses. They include grocery stores, mixed-use development, health care facilities, and foodbanks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s interesting to me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is some of those verticals are things that we need in Norfolk. … What I don&#8217;t know is how much effort has been expended by them to cause that to happen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGee noted that the board of HRV is a subset of the board of commissioners of the Norfolk Redevelopment and Housing Authority. &#8220;That&#8217;s something that seems like it needs more oversight,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As we add more NRHA board members with different skills and capabilities, I think that could benefit HRV.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Council member wants changes in proceeds use</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the four years since the Virginia Mercury’s </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/12/21/why-is-a-norfolk-community-development-entity-investing-everywhere-but-norfolk/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on HRV was published, the company has transferred more than $4.4 million to NRHA. In the 18 preceding years, it had transferred $1.3 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the report, which covers the first nine months of 2025, HRV had net income of more than $1 million and more than $10 million in checking and savings accounts. It contributed $800,000 to NRHA during 2025. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funds included $150,000 for two vehicles and support for workforce development and vocational skill training, &#8220;community improvements,&#8221; and &#8220;community engagement,&#8221; described as access to food and cultural enrichment activities, healthy community initiatives, and leadership training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGee said that&#8217;s not where that money should be spent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think the proceeds from HRV need to be spent on housing, potentially workforce housing. As I look at the history of how those monies have been used, I&#8217;m not convinced it&#8217;s the highest and best use,&#8221; he added. &#8220;When I think about board governance and improving that, a big component of that is ensuring that those dollars are spent on the right thing.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using profits from HRV to fund NRHA programs also defeats the purpose of the new markets tax credits program, which is intended to spur investment in distressed areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For every New Markets Tax Credits dollar invested in a neighborhood, the Treasury Department says it spurs $8 in private investment. </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/06/14/community-development-group-has-millions-that-could-be-used-in-norfolk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norfolk is a prime market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for that investment, with 16 severely distressed U.S. Census tracts given the highest priority for new markets tax allocations. The poverty rate in those ranges from 31% to as high as 80%, and the unemployment rate tops out at 40%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over three years ago, the City Council resolution pushing for the subsidiary to invest in Norfolk projects and seeking more oversight was passed after a </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/12/21/why-is-a-norfolk-community-development-entity-investing-everywhere-but-norfolk/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Mercury series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> detailed how HRV had invested only a fraction of the $360 million in tax credit allocations it had won in Norfolk over two decades. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That resolution said &#8220;HRV shall proactively seek Norfolk projects and not rely solely upon the Norfolk Economic Development Department. HRV’s proactive outreach shall include marketing the NMTC.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Virginia housing authorities have created entities like HRV that match projects with investors attracted by the favorable tax breaks with the new markets tax credits. They focus on projects in their cities or regions, often plowing the millions of dollars in administrative fees they earn back into local projects. They also open their meetings to public scrutiny. Hampton Roads Ventures does not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time in several years, HRV did not win a tax credit allocation in </span><a href="https://www.cdfifund.gov/system/files/2025-12/NMTC_CY24_25_Award_Book_Final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the most recent award</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to Treasury Department records. The for-profit subsidiary of NRHA has done projects in 17 states and the District of Columbia, according to Treasury Department data. It has not done a project in Norfolk since 2008.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HRV</span><a href="https://hamptonroadsventures.com/about-us/#team" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lists three employees:</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a chief executive officer, a portfolio manager, and an executive assistant. According to its 2024 audit, also filed with the city, it paid more than $530,000 in salaries in 2024, up from $489,000 the year before. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer Donohue, HRV&#8217;s CEO, did not respond to an email seeking comment. In the past, HRV&#8217;s lawyer has denied public records requests despite the company being a subsidiary of NRHA, a public body subject to records requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesman for the New Mexico Economic Development Department, which contributed a $400,000 grant to the Biltwise project, said the company was up and running under the name Fortified Structures of New Mexico and employed 58 people as of September. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Southeast Texas Foodbank and Resource Center</span><a href="https://youtu.be/4zxIgmm6Pzc?si=zVLyxj-fsFfqAZNf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expanded coverage to five counties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in East Texas, offering a WIC office, a location for vaccines, and the local health district in addition to the food pantry, a one-stop shop.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FCPS teacher Zenaida Perez, plaintiff in the case, is seeking to prove that school officials have defamed her and are in violation of the </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title2.2/chapter30.1/section2.2-3011/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Whistleblower Protection Law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Perez alleged in 2025 that another FCPS staff member assisted minors with seeking abortions. FCPS’ </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/17/fairfax-county-public-schools-lawyers-internal-probe-refutes-school-assisted-abortion-allegations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">internal probe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> refuted her claims. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.fcps.edu/news/message-superintendent-regarding-centreville-high-school" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from superintendent Michelle Reid claimed that Perez’ allegations are “based largely on statements that were misinterpreted, mistranslated, taken out of context, or in some cases knowingly fabricated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Virginia State Police investigation, launched late last summer by the order of former Gov. Glenn Youngkin, remains active as of January 2026. The school system has also submitted materials to members of Congress for a federal inquiry. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">She said, they said</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of Virginia’s gubernatorial and House of Delegates elections last fall, Perez</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/08/25/fairfax-abortion-allegations-fuel-new-political-firestorm-in-virginia-governors-race/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accused </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">a fellow school staff member of assisting students in obtaining abortions and the matter quickly became a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/08/25/fairfax-abortion-allegations-fuel-new-political-firestorm-in-virginia-governors-race/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican political talking point</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title16.1/chapter11/section16.1-241/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows minors to get abortions only if their parents or guardians agree to it or a minor successfully petitions a court. Such petitions are also exempt from the Freedom of Information Act, so it’s unclear how the students Perez purported to have gotten abortions would have obtained them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the public airing of the allegation and subsequent lawsuit came to light in recent months, Perez had first tried to report matters to Centreville High School administration in 2021 and 2022, the lawsuit revealed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August 2025, conservative blog </span><a href="https://www.wcdispatch.com/p/bolted-doors-and-broken-laws" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WC Dispatch published the allegations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a note allegedly written by a student who’d been assisted in getting an abortion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was afraid my family would react poorly if they knew about my pregnancy so I sought the abortion,” the note, translated from Spanish, reads in the court filing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A previous internal review by FCPS indicated </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/17/fairfax-county-public-schools-lawyers-internal-probe-refutes-school-assisted-abortion-allegations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">similarities between the handwriting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the student’s letter and Perez’ own; she then admitted that she was the one who actually wrote it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(The student) didn’t write it, she was absolutely not well with the writing — she cannot write in English or in Spanish — and she told me she ‘only had 15 minutes for my break,’” Perez said in an Americans United For Life webinar late last year. Perez added she had written the letter based on the student’s dictation while the student was working at a restaurant in Chantilly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys from Americans United For Life, the anti-abortion group that hosted the webinar, are representing Perez in her case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“AUL has filed an amended complaint on behalf of Mrs. Perez, and we are expecting a renewed motion to dismiss the case from Fairfax County’s lawyers,” AUL spokesman Gavin Oxley said Friday.</span></p>

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perez’s suit claims CHS officials retaliated against her through disciplinary memos, reprimands and a suspension. Her medical provider gave her medication for depression and anxiety, the suit stated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The filing noted the school officials’ alleged retaliation has a “lifelong impact” on Perez emotionally, and added that the defendants’ claims will “be a stain on her record forever and these allegations may resurface for any teaching position that she may seek in the future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school system remains steadfast in refuting Perez’s claims. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FCPS’ own review uncovered “no credible evidence” supporting Perez’s allegations. This was relayed in </span><a href="https://www.fcps.edu/form/supplemental-response-september-22-letter" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">materials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the school system sent to the U.S. Senate committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supplemental statement read that FCPS “remains open to receiving and reviewing any new, pertinent information that may become available” but concluded that  further investigation isn’t necessary at this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement also accusedPerez of withholding additional evidence when the Centreville High principal  initially looked into the alleged student abortions Perez reported to him in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While she has claimed to possess evidence of serious criminal wrongdoing occurring within the school and impacting students from vulnerable backgrounds, Mrs. Perez nonetheless waited nearly three years before surfacing the ‘evidence’ she had privately collected, choosing to do so through a sensational social media story she collaborated in producing, which contained numerous unfounded allegations,” the statement read. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perez, whose case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in the Alexandria division, is seeking a trial by jury and to be awarded $2 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AUL spokesman Oxley told The Mercury that the organization and their client are “looking forward” to “prosecuting the case as far as necessary.”</span></p>

(Photo by Robert Zullo/ States Newsroom)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill that would set up a framework for siting solar projects that localities could follow and that prohibits the premature rejection of solar infrastructure development has passed the Virginia Senate.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB347" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 347</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Sen. Schulyer VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, is a way to meet the state’s growing energy while combating political messaging against renewable energy sources that hampers development, the senator said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the big complaints has been that there are solar developers who come in and don&#8217;t do it the right way,” VanValkenburg said. “And so this lays out kind of basic guidance about what the right way might look like.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill is not a mandate for localities to approve solar projects but it would keep them from outright barring the energy projects from even applying for permits. Localities would still have the ability to approve or withhold permits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VanValkenburg said there are counties more readily approving data center development than they are energy production projects, which has made it more challenging for utilities to keep up with energy demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you actually look at the individual project, you talk to the property owner, you look at the economics of it for a locality. I think we&#8217;ll get more projects,” VanValkenburg said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recommended solar siting guidelines proposed in the bill are considered best practices that can give localities a framework for solar projects. The key recommendations for the location of the solar arrays:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-The project should be between 150-200 feet from the nearest point on the outer wall of existing occupied community buildings and dwellings on non-participating properties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-The project should be between 50-100 feet from the outside edge of the roadbed of any road abutting the property. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-The project should be between 100-250 feet from the edge of tidal wetlands or non-tidal </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wetlands, or perennial streams </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-The project should be between 50-75 feet from the nearest shared property line for nonparticipating properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During debate on the House companion bill, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB711" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 711</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, representatives of the Virginia Farm Bureau and the Association of Counties raised concerns that the standards laid out in the bill are one-size-fits-all parameters, although solar projects will vary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether it&#8217;s a one megawatt project, to a 100 MW project, they vary in size from several acres to square miles. There&#8217;s also differences in geography and physio-geographic provinces across the commonwealth,” said Joe Lerch with the Virginia Association of Counties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill may meet pushback from localities, Lerch said, “because our members just want to retain that ability to craft those ordinances and craft those agreements at the local level.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The senator emphasized that the legislation is not a requirement for localities to approve solar projects but it is an effort to help bridge some of the gaps in local decisions when it comes to determining how a solar project could look in their area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We do not believe that this is a magic bullet that is going to solve affordability and reliability and get more clean energy on a grid,” said Sarah Graham Taylor on behalf of </span><a href="https://marec.us/about/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marec Action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a coalition of renewable energy agencies that promotes the build out of solar and wind projects. “But it is an important step forward to getting more good projects sited, while still protecting landowner rights and local voting.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the increasing demand for energy and the requirements under the Virginia Clean Economy Act, VanValkenburg said this is a first step to prevent needing state intervention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I&#8217;d rather try doing that than do nothing. And in 2-3 years (if we do nothing), now we have to do something, you&#8217;ve left us with no choice. Every day that goes by where they do green light data centers and reject energy projects, that decision making gets moved up,” VanValkenburg said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the hearings for the bills, Virginia Farm Bureau representatives broached a common concern: the potential loss of agricultural land to solar projects. During community meetings in rural portions of the state, it is a familiar theme among residents, who often want to preserve the character of the county.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I get everybody being afraid that, you know, farmland&#8217;s gonna go away or, you know, this or that thing is gonna happen. But it&#8217;s really important to note that we&#8217;re not mandating anything here,” VanValkenburg responded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, who is carrying the house version of the bill, said that it won’t ensure that all solar projects are approved, but it is meant to weed out bad actors to put local residents at ease when it comes to considering a solar project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It sets the project standards ensuring communities and trust in solar facilities are well designed and responsibly managed,” Herring said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 347 cleared the Senate with a vote of 21-17. It now heads to the House for more debate. HB 711 awaits a vote on the House floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change to the rule made it so “major sources” of air pollution can be reclassified as “area sources” if there is an effort to reduce emissions. Once reclassified, they would no longer be subject to the major source limitations from the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutant (NESHAP). The polluters would also not be required to have a Title V operating permit if they stay below specific emissions thresholds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones said in a press release that the rule change allows the largest polluters to have less stringent guidelines to reduce the amount of harmful pollutants they release into the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Clean Air Act was put in place to prevent major polluters from releasing toxic emissions into our air that harm our communities and damage our health,” Jones said. “Donald Trump’s effort to create regulatory loopholes so major polluters can operate unchecked is disgraceful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia was removed from the lawsuit in 2024 by former Attorney General Jason Miyares, according to Jones’ office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2024, the Biden administration amended the rule to require the major pollution sources to remain in that classification. Now the Trump Administration has undone that change.. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the second major move by Jones to take a stand on environmental issues. Last week,  he announced that he halted the state’s appeal of a court’s determination that former Gov. Glenn Youngkin unlawfully removed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/22/spanberger-democratic-lawmakers-are-pressing-for-virginia-to-rejoin-rggi-heres-how-it-would-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly is quickly advancing </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB397" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in order to add the state back to the regional carbon capping program and restart the flow of funding for energy efficiency and flood resiliency projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones has not yet taken a stand on if Virginia will be joining Dominion Energy’s lawsuit against the Department of Interior that put a 90-day pause of the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, reportedly due to national security concerns. The project has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/20/work-resumes-on-coastal-virginia-offshore-wind-project-after-court-order-ends-federal-pause/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">since resumed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while court action continues.</span></p>

(Photo by Dan Brandenburg/Getty  Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a landlord sues a tenant for not paying their rent, the tenant must pay their missed rent up front while they defend themselves in court. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB281/text/HB281" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 281</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Katrina Callsen, D-Albemarle, would remove that requirement for tenants who withhold their rent due to a landlord’s failure to remedy critical maintenance issues or unlivable conditions that threaten the health and safety of residents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure would provide relief and protection for tenants experiencing a lack of heat, water or electricity, pest infestations, or hazardous mold.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wiSOupedq8"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/03/20/prince-george-resident-files-lawsuit-against-apartment-management-over-mold/">Prince George resident files lawsuit against apartment management over mold</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is so when the landlord sues them, they do not have to come up with all the money up front if they were withholding rent because the place was unlivable,” Callsen said. “It’s giving them some strength to push back when their rental isn’t meeting code, when it’s not a place that they can actually stay in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing state law broadly known as the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act sets standards for renters and  landlords. Callsen’s bill to adjust it is one of several legislative proposals that empower tenants in this year’s General Assembly session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others include </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB15" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">H B 15</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, which would extend a grace period for late rent payments from five days to 14 days before a landlord can begin eviction proceedings. The measure passed the legislature last year but was vetoed by former Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB95" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">H B 95 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria, would require landlords to work with residents who are behind on payments and offer payment plans for up to six months before terminating rental agreements. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB278" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">H B 278</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, would permit local governments to adopt anti-rent gauging policies if they choose to do so. This could allow localities to set caps on how much landlords are allowed to raise rents each year. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB174" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">H B 174</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach, addresses lease termination time frames for military personnel when they need to move for their jobs. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB14" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">H B 14,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also by Price, would enhance enforcement of the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act by localities. Similarly to Callsen’s bill, Price’s focuses on renters protections when landlords fail to resolve health and safety issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These bills appear to already be making an impact with some property owners and renters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://x.com/DelegateCallsen/status/2015541559475716566" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video posted to X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sunday, Callsen described a letter one of her constituents was sent from their management company that said the bills prompted the landlord to “proactively think about raising rents,” Callsen said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Should key proposals become law,” the letter reads, “we will need to adjust our current pricing structure to account for these increased operational costs, ensuring we can maintain the high level of service and compliance our clients expect.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter also said additional administrative work, documentation, inspections or legal reviews stemming from the new standards would justify the hike. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury obtained a copy of the letter from Callsen, which confirms its content as described in her X video. When asked for comment on the letter on Thursday, the company declined to comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, who is carrying the Senate version of the anti-rent-gouging bill said it is “disturbing to hear that folks are already having these kinds of conversations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it also makes her “feel really good about why I&#8217;m carrying the bill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noted Virginia’s</span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/landing-2021-affordable-housing-in-virginia.asp#:~:text=Renting%20a%20home%20can%20help,and%20very%20low%2Dincome%20households." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> housing shortage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is one contributing factor to housing affordability issues. Her bill, she emphasized, can give localities the ability to keep rents within ranges that “work for their communities.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that we are not going to be able to build our way immediately, and we know that this is a real burden and an affordability issue that all of us care about in Virginia, for the families who are facing sometimes 30% rent increases and no other place to go,” Boysko said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the various housing bills work their way through committees and each chamber, they will be debated repeatedly before they have a chance to get to Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s desk. Many of the proposals </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/12/18/spanberger-makes-affordability-centerpiece-of-2026-agenda-as-legislative-session-nears/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">align with her housing affordability plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Callsen’s district includes Charlottesville — a locality that has </span><a href="https://www.cvilletomorrow.org/city-council-approved-a-new-zoning-ordinance-that-re-envisions-charlottesville-as-a-denser-and-more-economically-diverse-city/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spent years </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://www.cvilletomorrow.org/five-years-later-charlottesville-has-a-new-comprehensive-plan/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">addressing </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">its own housing affordability issues — so she’s no stranger to the concerns of both landlords and tenants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, she said, “I am hopeful that we will have a little bit of a restoration of balance between tenants’ rights and landlords’ rights. Virginia is a very landlord-friendly state, which I can appreciate, but there are many ways that we can help tenants.”</span></p>

Virginia officials approved more than $545,000 in opioid settlement grants in January to support local treatment, recovery and prevention programs. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A committee of the Virginia Opioid Abatement Authority approved more than half a million dollars in new grants this month, directing settlement funds to five localities for programs aimed at reducing opioid use, expanding access to treatment and strengthening community-based responses to addiction and overdoses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a Jan. 20 meeting, the committee approved $545,429 in awards to Clarke, Franklin, Henrico and Patrick counties and the city of Fairfax. The grants will support a mix of new initiatives and expansions of existing programs, funded through Virginia’s share of national opioid settlements with manufacturers, distributors and retailers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These awards provide support to Virginia cities and counties to implement and expand opioid abatement programs that meet the current and future needs of their communities,” said Sen. Todd Pillion, R-Washington, chair of the OAA Board of Directors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia continues to lead the way in awarding opioid settlement funds for diverse, evidence-based projects at the community level.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authority has emphasized local decision-making as it distributes settlement funds, with projects designed to respond to needs identified by communities themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Awarding community-level projects really allows those on the front lines to steer the solutions and respond to what they are seeing,” said Del. Brianna Sewell, D-Prince William, treasurer of the OAA Board of Directors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clarke County received $14,700 to fund a substance use disorder intensive case manager who will work with families and children affected by addiction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The position will provide case management services aimed at reducing substance use in families, decreasing substance-related child abuse and neglect, and strengthening coordination among local and regional service providers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The county committed an additional $31,514 of its opioid settlement funds to support the effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Franklin County received two awards totaling $184,580, making it the largest overall recipient in this funding round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One award increases funding for the Grace House PEARL Program, a six- to 12-month recovery housing program for pregnant and postpartum women. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $99,575 increase will be used to purchase an additional home rather than renovate part of the existing facility, allowing the program to add three living units and expand capacity by about 60%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Franklin pledged an additional $138,920 in settlement funds to support the expansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The locality’s second award, totaling $73,500, will support a new Community Paramedicine Program administered by the Franklin County Public Safety Department. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program is designed to bridge gaps in health care access, reduce avoidable emergency department visits and improve long-term outcomes for vulnerable populations. While focused on opioid use disorder services, it will also address broader community risk reduction priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials estimate the program will directly benefit residents connected to roughly 150 opioid-related 911 calls received annually, while also providing prevention services, treatment referrals and education for people experiencing non-opioid substance use emergencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Franklin County committed an additional $23,750 in settlement funds, and only 50% of the personnel costs are covered by the OAA grant to ensure non-abatement activities are funded separately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henrico County received $275,000 to contract with an organization that will provide substance use education and training for up to 20 faith-based leaders representing a range of religions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the course of up to a year, participants will receive training on substance use, prevention, recovery and harm reduction, and be connected with local treatment and support. The program is expected to reach more than 5,000 people through participating congregations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patrick County was awarded $18,945 to enhance services for the Piedmont Adult Recovery Court and expand mental health and substance use disorder treatment within the county jail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding will support a peer support specialist, a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner, a licensed therapist, a justice support supervisor and the purchase of an SUV. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The county pledged an additional $145,211 in settlement funds following a needs assessment that identified gaps in services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city of Fairfax received $63,709 to launch the first phase of a proof-of-concept project using artificial intelligence-enabled virtual reality training for multidisciplinary crisis response teams. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In partnership with George Mason University’s College of Public Health Lab for Immersive Technologies and Simulation, the city will develop immersive, scenario-based training focused on opioid-related crisis and post-crisis response, with an emphasis on strengthening the role of certified peer recovery specialists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the authority continues awarding grants, officials say early investments are beginning to show results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are beginning to see the results of the early rounds of OAA grants come to fruition, and it is wonderful to see more cities and counties applying these funds to help save lives in their communities,” said Dr. Sarah Thomason, vice chair of the OAA Board of Directors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, the Opioid Abatement Authority has funded more than 171 active projects across the commonwealth. Established by the General Assembly in 2021, the authority oversees 55% of Virginia’s opioid settlement funds. Another 30% is distributed directly to cities and counties, with the remaining 15% allocated to the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s settlement payments began in 2022 and are expected to exceed $1.1 billion by the time they end in 2041. Court orders and state law restrict the use of the funds to opioid abatement and remediation efforts.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1491" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1491</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Del. J.J. Singh, D-Loudoun, and Del. John McAuliff, D-Fauquier,  directs the SCC, when considering the approval of transmission lines that are more powerful than 136 kv, to try to the greatest extent possible to keep the lines over 500 feet away from schools, residential properties, daycares, parks, playgrounds, recreational areas, or places of worship. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also aims to limit lines that would impede on the locality’s plan for a space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Singh’s district, the Loudoun Valley Estates neighborhoods and county government have been </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/09/19/loudoun-transmission-line-debate-aims-scc-to-respond-to-data-center-needs-resident-concerns/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rallying against Dominion Energy’s plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build a 165 foot 500kv line, dubbed the Golden to Mars line, through the Ashburn neighborhoods to bring more power to scores of nearby data centers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the Loudoun County School Board voted against allowing the transmission lines to be built on their properties, which led to Dominion Energy to create a new route that cuts through the backyards of some of the homeowners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The residents in those neighborhoods have stated they </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/nova-lawmakers-urge-scc-to-find-new-options-for-transmission-lines-that-would-cut-ashburn-community/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have major concerns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about potential health impacts from living below the high-powered lines and about their home values dropping due to the massive towers being placed in or near their yards, which would require vegetation and landscaping to be cleared away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s never been definitive proof that there are no risks for co-locating near massive transmission lines,” Singh said in an interview Thursday. “Property values decline when you have transmission lines so close to your house and we have incredible power needs in Loudoun County, some of which is driven by the data center sector.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/12/16/loudoun-residents-take-fight-against-high-voltage-power-lines-for-data-center-alley-to-scc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">community members have mounted a strong campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against all of the proposed routes leading up to the evidentiary hearing. The Loudoun Board of Supervisors previously voted against two of the proposed routes that would run along the Loudoun County Parkway, stating that the transmission lines did not fit the aesthetic characteristics of the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion maintains that the Golden to Mars line is part of a “reliability loop,” a three-pronged transmission line to connect substations to bring power to the high volume of data centers. If the final portion of the loop is not built, it could create issues for the existing infrastructure and there is a possibility of facing violations from PJM, the regional grid operator, for not providing the power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been an effort by residents and local officials to put the transmission lines underground. Dominion has pushed back on the idea stating it would take up too much land for the transition sites and be too expensive of a cost to pass down to ratepayers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singh is also supporting legislation that helps localities with their zoning for the data center industry, which would allow leaders and residents to have a better understanding of the environmental, sound, water, and other impacts that could be caused by individual projects. The goal is to prevent concerns prompted by the Golden to Mars project in Loudoun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We should be addressing this problem even before it gets to that point,” Singh said. “Localities should have the tools in their zoning to prevent those data centers from going so close to residential communities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SCC’s decision on which proposed transmission line route will be selected, if any, has not yet been announced. HB 1491 will be heard in committee next week.</span></p>

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jay Jones joined 21 colleagues on Thursday in sharply condemning the U.S. Department of Justice’s latest push to force Minnesota officials </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/us/politics/minnesota-trump-voter-rolls.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to surrender</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sensitive state data and dismantle public-safety policies as a condition for federal cooperation, calling it unconstitutional and an overreach of federal power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the multistate coalition — led by New York Attorney General Letitia James — </span><a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2026/attorney-general-james-leads-multistate-coalition-condemning-doj-threats-against" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused President Donald Trump’s  administration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of exploiting recent violence and unrest in Minnesota overimmigration crackdowns to strong-arm state leaders into acquiescing to demands that “intrude on state sovereignty” and conflict with ongoing litigation and court-ordered protections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia honors our highly skilled law enforcement agencies that protect our communities and uphold the Constitution,” Jones said in a statement. “We are deeply concerned about the tactics and strategies employed by the federal government in other states that have cost lives and put others at risk in the name of immigration enforcement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Jan. 29 missive was prompted by Bondi’s Jan. 24 letter to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, which threatened to withhold federal agents unless Minnesota surrendered Medicaid and SNAP data, opened access to voter registration information and rolled back key local public safety policies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal officials framed the demands as a step toward restoring order after clashes between local communities and federal immigration officers in Minneapolis and surrounding areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minnesota officials have fought back. The state, along with Minneapolis and Saint Paul, sued the Department of Homeland Security and related federal agencies </span><a href="https://www.minneapolismn.gov/news/2026/january/ag-lawsuit/?utm_source" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to halt a massive immigration enforcement campaign dubbed </span><a href="https://www.publicrightsproject.org/minnesota-v-noem-operation-metro-surge-fact-sheet/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Operation Metro Surge,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alleging the deployment of thousands of armed agents violated the Constitution and endangered residents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal scholars and congressional Democrats have similarly raised alarms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several U.S. senators, including Alex Padilla of California and Dick Durbin of Illinois, </span><a href="https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-durbin-colleagues-urge-trumps-justice-department-to-cease-pressure-campaign-to-obtain-states-sensitive-voter-data-purge-voter-rolls/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have pressed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Justice Department to abandon what they call an unlawful push to centralize sensitive voter data and purge rolls, warning the campaign undermines state election officials’ authority and data privacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The confrontation in Minnesota comes amid a broader national showdown over immigration policy and state versus federal authority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Trump administration has pursued aggressive enforcement actions against so-called sanctuary jurisdictions that limit local cooperation with federal immigration officials, </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-administration-sues-boston-over-sanctuary-limits-immigration-cooperation-2025-09-04/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filing lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against cities from Boston to Chicago and Colorado over their policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In several cases, federal courts have sided with states and localities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal judge </span><a href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/united-states-department-justice-lawsuit-illinois-cook-county-chicago-sanctuary-city-policies-dismissed-judge/17295816/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismissed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Department of Justice’s lawsuit targeting sanctuary policies in Illinois and Cook County last year, and another court blocked Trump-era efforts to withhold federal funds from sanctuary jurisdictions, ruling such conditions unconstitutional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in Minnesota, federal courts continue to shape the dispute. A judge recently issued a temporary restraining order against a controversial federal policy targeting lawful refugees in the state while allowing the government to continue reviewing cases under narrower parameters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal response has drawn judiciary pushback beyond data demands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Minneapolis, U.S. District Judge Patrick J. Schiltz </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-blocks-trump-policy-targeting-minnesotas-refugees-2026-01-29/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sharply rebuked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Immigration and Customs Enforcement for ignoring scores of court orders during its intensified enforcement operations, warning that the pattern threatened the rule of law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public protest and political pressure — </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/26/in-newly-democratic-virginia-immigration-enforcement-becomes-early-test-for-spanberger/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">including in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — have escalated the conflict. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent deaths involving federal agents, including two high-profile shootings in Minnesota, have fueled widespread demonstrations and calls to scale back enhanced operations. Nationwide protest movements </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/28/third-no-kings-protest-march-minnesota-ice?" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like “No Kings”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are organizing larger rallies around federal authority and civil rights issues tied to immigration enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the backlash, border enforcement officials have signaled a shift. Tom Homan, the administration’s border czar, </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/ice-appears-shift-gears-minnesota-amid-mixed-messaging-trump-2026-01-29/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has indicated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a potential draw-down of agents in Minnesota, focusing on targeted operations with greater cooperation from state and local leaders, though messaging remains mixed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones and the coalition made clear in Thursday’s letter that their states will “stand firm against unlawful federal interference” and defend both state sovereignty and the rights of residents, urging the administration to rescind its demands immediately “before anyone else gets hurt.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States joining the letter included Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia. </span></p>

County supervisors said in a statement read at the start of the meeting that they hoped the Department of Homeland Security "will not proceed with this acquisition and sincerely hope they will look for a more suitable location for this type of operation." (Photo courtesy Joseph Papa)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid nationwide shock over recent ICE-related deaths in Minneapolis that have ignited protests and debate over federal immigration enforcement, the Hanover County Board of Supervisors on Wednesday pushed back against a U.S. Department of Homeland Security plan to convert a newly built warehouse off Lakeridge Parkway into an immigration detention processing facility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 500 protesters — along with some supporters of ICE’s enforcement efforts — gathered outside the county administration building and residents filled the meeting room to capacity to voice overwhelming opposition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the start of the meeting, with the boardroom packed and additional residents watching from an overflow room in the hallway, Board Chair Sean Davis read a statement drafted by supervisors during a closed session earlier in the day, marking the county’s first official response to the federal proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The board opposes the purchase of this property by DHS because of well planned current land uses,” Davis said, drawing applause from the audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least 171 speakers signed up to address the board during the marathon public comment session, with most urging supervisors to block the project, warning it would fundamentally alter the character of the area and strain county resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A handful of supporters of the facility also spoke, citing public safety concerns and backing ICE’s enforcement mission.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">County says it was not consulted on site selection</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Hanover County received </span><a href="https://assets.vpm.org/a4/e1/e5804c594092992267d0b584f752/dhs-hanover-county-ice-processing-facility-letter.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a letter from DHS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> confirming its intent to purchase a 43.49-acre site at 11525 Lakeridge Parkway in Ashland, where a 552,576-square-foot warehouse built in 2024 currently stands vacant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The building had been marketed as a potential distribution center and is owned by Canadian developer Jim Pattison Developments, based in Vancouver. County tax records show the property is expected to be assessed </span><a href="https://virginiabusiness.com/ice-plans-hanover-warehouse-processing-facility/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at $50.48 million this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to DHS, the warehouse could be renovated or rebuilt to support U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, potentially including “construction of holding and processing spaces.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the letter offered few specifics, including how many people would be detained, whether detention would be short- or long-term, staffing levels or a project timeline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DHS gave the county 30 days to respond. In a notice posted on the county’s website Thursday, officials said Hanover plans to reply within that timeframe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davis emphasized Wednesday that the county was not consulted before the site was selected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hanover County did not request that DHS select this property, was not involved in the selection process and was not consulted by the federal government prior to being notified,” Davis said, reading from the board’s statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that the county had also not been asked whether the project aligned with its comprehensive plan or land-use policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While federal facilities are exempt from local zoning rules, supervisors raised concerns about the site’s proximity to retail businesses, hotels, restaurants, residential neighborhoods and a historic district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The property also sits within the Lewistown Commerce Center Community Development Authority, an area intended for planned commercial and industrial development, and borders county-owned land reserved for future public use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Simply put, a DHS facility at this property on Lakeridge Parkway is not consistent with the established land use for this business, residential and commerce area,” Davis said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board warned that converting the site to a federal detention facility would reduce county tax revenues by at least $1 million annually and impose unplanned demands on local services, including public safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While the board has no role in federal immigration policy, we are responsible for land use, budget decisions and ensuring transparency and public engagement on matters within the board’s authority,” Davis said. “Based on what we know today, this property is not the right location for this type of operation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board directed county staff and the county attorney to evaluate potential impacts and submit a formal response to DHS by mid-February. Supervisors also said they have asked Virginia’s congressional delegation to help identify alternative sites and are reviewing possible legal options.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Most residents urge board to stop project</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along Route 54, protesters blocked traffic toward the building. Inside, speakers opposing the facility were frequently met with applause, both in the main chamber and the overflow hallway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kimberly Matthews of Mechanicsville told supervisors that fear was already spreading through the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m here to tell you that your people are scared,” Matthews said. “This is where we stop that. This is the line in the sand. This is when we say no.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Rev. Sterling Severns, pastor of Tabernacle Baptist Church in Richmond and an Ashland resident, thanked the board for its stance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I love the people of this county,” Severns said. “I rejoice tonight in hearing the decision that was made earlier today, and you are to be commended for it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several speakers raised concerns about the facility’s proximity to a historically Black community that was the epicenter of the state’s most high profile environmental justice battle in recent years.. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patricia Hunter Jordan, speaking on behalf of the Hanover County NAACP, noted the site is roughly a half-mile from Brown Grove, a recognized historic district. Residents of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/09/brown-grove-residents-case-against-wegmans-hanover-county-to-get-new-review-in-appellate-court/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown Grove</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fiercely opposed a massive Wegmans distribution center that was built in the community in 2024, citing environmental concerns and worries about how the facility would impact residents, many of whom are elderly people of color. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This facility would only be a half mile from Brown Grove, once again putting a burden on this historically Black community,” Jordan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faith leaders also warned of broader moral and social consequences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marc Stevenson, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Virginia, said detention facilities nationwide have become “hotbeds of neglect.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To welcome such a facility over the welcome of human beings is to question the values that shape our community,” Stevenson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Camilla Hill of Ashland questioned whether the project would provide any tangible benefit to Hanover residents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A detention center will impose long-term costs on the county while offering no benefit,” Hill said. “The federal government&#8217;s lack of planning is not our emergency.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Supporters cite public safety, law enforcement</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some speakers supported the proposal, urging supervisors to prioritize law enforcement and immigration enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tina Steinberg of Ashland said she backed the facility and criticized protesters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ICE is protecting the rule of law,” Steinberg said. “Please stand in unity with ICE to protect this country and keep its people safe from violent criminals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kristen Holte, a resident of the Cold Harbor District, echoed those sentiments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I 100% approve of the Department of Homeland Security having a warehouse on Lakeridge Parkway, or somewhere else in Hanover County,” Holte said. “Please do not delay this proposed facility.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover’s situation is not unique in Virginia. The Washington Post reported in December that President Donald Trump’s administration is seeking to convert industrial warehouses into large-scale immigrant detention facilities, including a potential site in Stafford County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davis reiterated the board’s commitment to transparency and continued communication throughout this process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We appreciate how engaged and informed our residents continue to be,” Davis said. “While many recognize the board’s limitations on this matter, we will continue to provide updates as accurate information becomes available.”</span></p>

(Photo courtesy of the Library of Virginia)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia legislature plans to address the impact of a racist 1920s policy that for decades prohibited Native American children from pursuing education beyond seventh or eighth grade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.lva.virginia.gov/collections/educator-resources/dbva/items/show/226" target="_blank">Racial Integrity Act</a>, which was overturned in 1967, forced many to leave the commonwealth for states like Kansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now lawmakers are considering a proposal to offer in-state tuition to non-Virginia students who are part of a federally recognized Virginia Native American tribe. The measure could encourage affected tribe members to return, and is one of several aimed at refining the government-to-government relationship Virginia maintains through a treaty with the federally recognized tribal nations in the commonwealth.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia recognizes 11 tribes in total, and seven of those are federally recognized, according to the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Faulkner, a citizen of the Upper Mattaponi Indian Tribe, said her tribe’s well-being and educational opportunities were directly impacted by the Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which </span><a href="https://www.lva.virginia.gov/collections/educator-resources/dbva/items/show/226" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">classified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginians as either “white,” “colored” or “mixed.” Native Americans were considered “colored,” along with Black people, effectively erasing Indigenous identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law also denied tribes legal recognition, outlawed interracial marriage and relegated Native children to underfunded schools with limited resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law was part of a larger system that kept Virginia Native children in separate, substandard schools, which usually offered education only through seventh or eighth grade. Because public high schools were closed to them, many children had to leave the state for out-of-state or boarding schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of the Act, records provided to lawmakers indicate a significant number of Native AmericansIndians who left the commonwealth. Some records indicated that 45% of the Upper Mattaponi Indian Tribe&#8217;s 685 enrolled citizens live outside Virginia, primarily in Philadelphia and Florida.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faulkner said the new bills could repair some of these past harms and, by making higher education accessible, help tribes reestablish their communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia, in my opinion, has the best schools in the nation, and this (bill) really helps to rebuild our tribal communities by getting our young people to hopefully come back and stay here in the commonwealth,” said Faulkner.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the bills would do and how they were developed</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB287" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shelly Simonds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Newport News, and Sen. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB456" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard Stuart</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, R-King George, are carrying proposals that would make any non-Virginia student who is a member or citizen of a </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/01/08/2024-00109/indian-entities-recognized-by-and-eligible-to-receive-services-from-the-united-states-bureau-of" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federally recognized tribe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and enrolled in an undergraduate degree program eligible for in-state tuition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the proposal allows the governing board of any public institution of higher education to charge in-state tuition to such students enrolled in a graduate or professional degree program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s </span><a href="https://www.schev.edu/financial-aid/in-state-residency" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in-state tuition policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires individuals to prove they live in the commonwealth and plan to stay indefinitely to establish domicile. After this, they must continue living in Virginia for at least one year before the first day of classes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers worked with the Virginia Commission on Updating Virginia Law to Reflect Federal Recognition of Virginia Tribes and the University of Virginia’s </span><a href="https://www.law.virginia.edu/clinics/state-and-local-government-policy-clinic" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State and Local Government Policy Clinic,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which provides non-partisan legal and policy research support to state and local government officials in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The clinic has assisted legislators from both parties in securing the passage of more than 25 laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson Martingayle, a student enrolled in the clinic, helped write the tuition proposal, which is similar to successful efforts in other states, including Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_46372" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:640px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-46372 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/service-pnp-cph-3b30000-3b39000-3b39700-3b39702r.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="470" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/service-pnp-cph-3b30000-3b39000-3b39700-3b39702r.jpg 640w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/service-pnp-cph-3b30000-3b39000-3b39700-3b39702r-300x220.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Students in class learning how to prepare sulphuric acid at Hampton Institute, Hampton, Virginia — a historic moment of hands-on scientific education.

<p>Based on survey responses from five out of seven of Virginia&#8217;s federally recognized tribes, approximately 21 out-of-state tribal youth high school graduates per year would be eligible for in-state tuition if they apply and are admitted to Virginia&#8217;s public colleges and universities.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It feels great we have so many phenomenal universities in the commonwealth and to make it easier for more students — especially those who have roots in the commonwealth and whose families have been effectively displaced from the state in the past — to come back to this place where they do have roots at a much more affordable price, is truly amazing,” Martingayle said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been a huge honor for us to be able to serve the commission as a whole, and tribal leaders in particular, and help them develop and advocate for long overdue changes to Virginia law,” said Andrew Block, the Clinic’s director. “We&#8217;ve learned so much along the way that&#8217;s been really valuable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emily Becker and Andrew Lee, students who also assisted the commission, explained that over the past few months, they presented their findings to lawmakers and then spoke with representatives from the tribes, describing both experiences as a huge honor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that was a pretty momentous moment for us,” Becker said. “It felt really special to be able to stand up there and articulate some of these goals and describe the work that we had done to the commission.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process was also a learning experience for seasoned lawmakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We can learn a lot from (Virginia’s tribes) and the fact that they&#8217;ve been able to survive all these generations, even though we have Walter Plecker, who was a white supremacist and tried to erase them and erase Black people, we&#8217;re learning from everybody,” said Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, who served as the commission chair. “That&#8217;s why education is so critical.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Bills to expand tribal sovereignty up for debate </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple House and Senate lawmakers are proposing amendments that prioritize formal recognition and mandatory consultation with American Indian tribes on infrastructure, land use and historic preservation decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krizek and Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, are carrying </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB368" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 368</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB356" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 356.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These bills update state laws to include standard definitions for who is considered an &#8220;American Indian&#8221; or a member of a &#8220;federally recognized tribe.&#8221; They also specify that Virginia recognizes the inherent sovereignty, or the right to self-govern, of these tribes, which has been a persistent challenge, according to some Native Americans in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Getting the legislators and the government of the commonwealth to understand that sovereignty isn&#8217;t something that they give or take away … is a hard concept for somebody to understand as an intangible,” said Thomas Badamo, a citizen of the Nansemond Indian Tribe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krizek and McDougle are also sponsoring </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB367" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 367</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB353" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 353, which</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would require state agencies to engage in &#8220;meaningful and timely consultation&#8221; with tribes before issuing permits for major projects, such as highway construction or large water use. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB483" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dave Marsden</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Fairfax, and Krizek are carrying a proposal to create a Tribal Medicaid Advisory Group. This group will allow tribal and state health officials to collaborate on policies and insurance plans like Medicaid that affect tribal communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB134" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcus Simon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Fairfax, and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB422" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stuart</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed proposals to update the Virginia Conservation Easement Act. The updates would allow federally recognized tribes to be &#8220;holders&#8221; of conservation easements who can acquire, protect, and manage land to preserve its natural beauty or historical importance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB349" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen McLaughlin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, R-Rockbridge, and Marsden are proposing that the Department of Emergency Management coordinate with tribes during disaster planning. Tribes would then be included in statewide safety assessments and search-and-rescue planning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these efforts could heighten the visibility of Virginia tribes’ cultures and identities, which Virginia&#8217;s first Ombudsman for Tribal Consultation Kara Canaday said is a challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of people do not realize tribes are still here in Virginia,” Canaday said. She connects Virginia tribes to state agencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Native tribes are “working very diligently for that visibility,” Canaday said. “It&#8217;s been a lot of hiding for a lot of years, and now we are reawakening our languages and shamelessly wearing culturally identifying clothing. I will often wear ribbon skirts to work or to events that we have here at the Capitol that lets people know we are still here. It&#8217;s something that we take pride in because that&#8217;s who we are.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deadline for bills to clear each chamber is Feb. 17. If successful, the proposals move to the other chamber for consideration. Gov. Abigail Spanberger would then be responsible for signing any proposals.</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Indigenous history teaching materials bill pitched</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Jessica Anderson, D-Williamsburg, is carrying </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB288" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 288.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This bill would require Virginia’s Department of Education to clearly post links on its website to teaching materials about Virginia’s Indigenous peoples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the proposal, a tribal education group would provide the teaching materials. This ensures teachers, students, and the public can easily find accurate resources about Native tribes in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reggie Stewart, chair of the Virginia Tribal Education Consortium, which works with VDOE, said that because Virginia’s instructional materials lack adequate coverage of Virginia Native history, it is important for Virginia tribes to tell their own story and ensure its accuracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re the ones who made contact with the settlers in 1607, and so we know our own history, and so we should be considered a credible source for that information,&#8221; Stewart said. &#8220;We would hope that the Virginia Department of Education would look at it from that perspective as well and look to partner with us more in the future.”</span></p>

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, there is no state policy that sets a minimum for paid sick days, so it’s up to companies whether they offer them or not. A multi-year effort to require paid sick leave for workers is up for debate in the legislature again this year and advocates hope it will finally become law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A handful of workers participated in a panel discussion on paid sick leave at the Virginia General Assembly building on Wednesday to share their experiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electrician Evan Hargreaves said during his days as a restaurant worker, he literally could not afford to get sick. When he came down with COVID-19 two years ago and had to take a few days off, he had to negotiate being late on rent with his landlord. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since some businesses refuse to do it on their own accord, it’s necessary that the legislature pass paid sick days legislation,” Hargreaves said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia does have a paid sick leave</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title40.1/chapter3/article2.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> law,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it applies to a narrow scope of workers. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 5 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Del. Kelly Convirs-Fowler, D-Virginia Beach, would expand that to all public and private sector employees in the state. Workers would be able to earn one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a behavior support clinician, La’Tavia Lowe provides at-home and in-clinic therapy for children with autism. Each day she interacts with several families. Lowe also works as a Door Dasher to help make ends meet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting sick forces her to weigh if she can afford to stay home and “puts undue stress on my shoulders,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Family medicine doctor David Clark, another panelist, said that after he treats some patients and offers them a doctor’s note, they tell him their employers won’t accept it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling it “a public health risk,” he said that ensuring people can take days off can help ensure anything ranging from a common cold to more serious issues don’t spread as easily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relatedly, the legislature is also pushing for a paid family medical leave bill. The bill for paid sick days can help people handle minor short-term illnesses or care for family members that have them, while the paid family medical leave bill would help those dealing with longer-term illnesses or recovering from surgeries. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, would create a state-run partial payment system to help people take time off work for medical reasons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grocery store worker and panelist LaChae Kelly-Taliaferro said both proposals would have been helpful when her late husband was ill. Between his surgery and hospital stays, work, and three children she could not afford to take time off work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everyone needs to understand that everyone gets sick,” she said and credited her local union with supporting her during her family’s hardship.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both sick leave bills are priorities for the democrat-controlled legislature and align with Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s goals of addressing Virginians’ affordability issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Interfaith Center For Public Policy director LaKeisha Cook said Spanberger’s stance and the Democratic majority means the sick leave bills will be less likely to face a veto. Once bills clear both chambers governors can choose to amend them, veto them or sign them into law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the alignment in intention between both branches of government, full implementation may come down to budgeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://lis.blob.core.windows.net/files/1097563.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fiscal analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Department of Planning and Budget anticipates the paid sick leave bill would increase general fund expenses by $14 million and nongeneral fund expenses by $12 million, beginning in the fiscal year of 2028.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State lawmakers are already bracing for how many expenditures the state may have to absorb amid federal </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2025-10-14/glenn-youngkin-federal-grants-trump-cummings-lucas-torian-vpm-wamu" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funding cuts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/05/heres-what-virginia-is-doing-so-far-to-reduce-its-snap-error-rate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">changes to social services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/07/24/virginia-lawmakers-health-officials-brace-for-medicaid-changes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">medical programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> typically funded and facilitated by the federal government. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We do realize that this comes with a price tag,” Cook said. “We know that this won’t be easy to push across the finish line, but we’re feeling confident.”</span></p>

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democrats on Wednesday rolled out a package of bills designed to curb federal immigration enforcement activities in the commonwealth. The lawmakers framed their effort as a public safety measure to protect the state’s immigrant communities and other residents, following deadly clashes between ICE agents and protesters in Minnesota and as media </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/24/poll-republicans-ice-immigration-deportations-00744668" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">polls</span></a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-immigration-approval-drops-record-low-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2026-01-26/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">show</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Americans’ </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-trump-greenland-trump-poll/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growing discontent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the federal government’s aggressive campaign to rout out undocumented immigrants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposals, which have been filed but not yet advanced through committee, would restrict where and how federal immigration and border patrol agents can operate and limit cooperation from state and local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a morning news conference at the state Capitol in Richmond, Democratic lawmakers said the legislation aims to prevent what they described as aggressive, unaccountable federal enforcement actions from taking place in Virginia communities and to ensure immigrants and other residents can access schools, hospitals, courthouses and polling places without fear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“House Democrats are here for one reason. We’re charged with protecting all Virginians,” Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, told reporters. “It’s Virginia citizens, all Virginia residents, our neighbors, and keeping our communities safe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simon tied the legislative push to the deaths of </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2026/01/24/us/minneapolis-shooting-alex-pretti-timeline.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex Pretti</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a hospital ICU nurse who cared for veterans, and </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/minneapolis-ice-shooting-minute-minute-timeline-renee-nicole/story?id=129021809" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renee Nicole Good</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Minnesota mother of three, during recent federal enforcement actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alex Pretti, a VA hospital ICU nurse, was just trying to help a woman who’d been knocked to the ground, he was shot in the back 10 times by federal agents. He was shot like a dog in the street. Renee Good, a mother of three, shot in the head,” Simon said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats did not provide a response Wednesday on a reported federal plan to </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/article_f468e2eb-de46-44ff-98c2-48b36d5cfef3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">establish an ICE detention facility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Hanover County, nor did they elaborate in detail on the bills they expect to advance this session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislative push comes as immigration enforcement has become one of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/26/in-newly-democratic-virginia-immigration-enforcement-becomes-early-test-for-spanberger/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the earliest tests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s administration, following Democrats’ takeover of statewide offices and both chambers of the General Assembly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after her Jan. 17 inauguration as Virginia’s 75th governor, Spanberger </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/17/spanberger-sworn-in-as-virginias-first-woman-governor-moves-swiftly-to-set-agenda/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">moved quickly to reverse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a signature Republican immigration policy by rescinding former Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s executive order that had urged state police and corrections officers to help carry out federal immigration enforcement, a step that advocates said fueled fear in immigrant communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Spanberger’s move did not end existing agreements between state or local agencies with the federal government. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic lawmakers said their own proposals are designed to draw clearer boundaries between federal immigration enforcement and state and local institutions, particularly schools, hospitals, courthouses and polling places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can enforce the law and respect the Constitution,” Simon said. “We hold criminals accountable without terrorizing communities. That&#8217;s what real public safety looks like.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Bills restricting enforcement locations and cooperation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several of the new proposals were introduced by Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington, who said they are intended to prevent immigration enforcement from interfering with access to essential services and democratic participation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1440" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1440</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would prohibit federal immigration enforcement in certain “protected areas” owned or operated by the state or local governments, including hospitals and health care facilities, schools at all levels, offices of commonwealth’s attorneys and other locations designated by the attorney general.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the proposal, employees of those facilities could not knowingly allow federal immigration enforcement into nonpublic areas for enforcement purposes. Violations would be punishable as a Class 1 misdemeanor, with limited exceptions.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1441" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1441</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would restrict state and local law-enforcement officers from assisting or cooperating </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with federal immigration enforcement operations, unless they are acting under a valid judicial warrant, subpoena or detainer, or are otherwise required by law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1442" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1442</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would prohibit immigration enforcement activity within 40 feet of polling places, locations where election results are being certified, or recount sites. Lopez said the legislation is meant to ensure that voters are not deterred from participating in elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Public safety includes protecting the most fundamental right in a democracy, the right to vote without fear,” Lopez said. “What we have seen from ICE agents is intimidation.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Courthouse protections</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another proposal, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB650" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 650</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Katrina Callsen, D-Albemarle, would restrict civil arrests inside courthouses. At the Chesterfield County Courthouse alone, at least 14 undocumented individuals </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/06/27/hallowed-ground-desecrated-ice-sweeps-at-chesterfield-court-draw-fierce-backlash/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">were arrested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last summer, drawing sharp rebukes from public officials, civil rights groups and lawmakers but praise from former Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure would prohibit such arrests of people who are attending court proceedings, traveling to court or leaving court, including witnesses and family members, unless the arresting authority presents a judicial warrant or order that has been reviewed by a designated official.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violations would be punishable as contempt of court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Courthouses should be places of justice, not fear,” Callsen said at the news conference. “People have to be able to enter a courthouse to testify, attend hearings and comply with the law without worrying that they&#8217;ll be snatched, detained or disappear on their way in the door.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Callsen said the bill is aimed at preventing a breakdown in the justice system when people are afraid to participate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When people are afraid to show up, crimes go unreported,” she said. “That is not what public safety is about.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Data, masking and cooperation limits</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other bills filed this session address transparency and cooperation with federal authorities.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 7</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, introduced in December by former Del. Mike Jones, D-Richmond, now a state senator, would prohibit most state and federal law-enforcement officers from wearing facial coverings while performing official duties, with exceptions for health protection and tactical operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would create criminal penalties, allow civil lawsuits against officers who violate the rule and eliminate sovereign immunity as a defense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1438" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1438</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Elizabeth Guzman, D-Prince William, would prohibit state and local agencies from entering into agreements that authorize officers to perform federal immigration enforcement functions. Existing agreements would have to be terminated by Sept. 1, 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would also limit inquiries into a person’s immigration status and create a cause of action for violations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, said data privacy and constitutional protections are also central to the legislative effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one should have their personal information swept up, shared or misused without due process or without their consent,” Tran said. “Our legislation is proactive. It’s responsible, and quite frankly, it&#8217;s our duty.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate counterparts</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the hall, Sen. Saddam Azlan Salim, D-Fairfax, announced earlier this week that he introduced companion legislation, including bills mirroring the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB351" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">courthouse arrest restrictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB352" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">facial covering bans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A third bill, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB783" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 783</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would limit agreements between state or local agencies and federal immigration authorities and expand data-collection requirements under the </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title52/chapter6.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Community Policing Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to track the presence and actions of federal immigration officers during stops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Salim sharply criticized recent federal enforcement actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ICE has murdered another Minnesotan, and we need to call it what it is: state violence, plain and simple,” Salim said, adding that his bills are intended to ensure that “no agency, no badge, and no president is above the law or the value of a human life.”</span></p>
<p>All three of Salim&#8217;s proposals advanced in a Senate Committee Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican leaders pushed back on the Democratic proposals Wednesday, arguing the focus should remain on economic issues rather than challenging immigration enforcement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, and Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, said Democrats are straying from an affordability agenda that leaders in both parties have identified as a top priority this session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That should be the focus,” McDougle said. “Not political games like gerrymandering, not political games like fighting with D.C.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked about the Democratic measures, Kilgore said, “Virginia has absolutely no say in what the federal government is doing.”</span></p>

(Photo by Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers on Tuesday advanced a bill creating a task force that would examine whether the Virginia Military Institute should remain a publicly funded, state-sponsored institution, marking the most consequential legislative step yet in a debate over the school’s governance and culture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal is part of a broader push by Democratic lawmakers to impose new oversight on VMI following a 2021 </span><a href="https://www.schev.edu/home/showpublisheddocument/1905/637919378545470000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state-commissioned investigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that found persistent disparities, cultural barriers and a lack of accountability at the school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VMI leaders have said they continue working with state officials to demonstrate progress and the institution&#8217;s value to the commonwealth.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Ps1xiwY2Y0"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/27/bills-targeting-vmi-governance-gain-traction-in-general-assembly/">Bills targeting VMI governance gain traction in General Assembly</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Bills targeting VMI governance gain traction in General Assembly&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/27/bills-targeting-vmi-governance-gain-traction-in-general-assembly/embed/#?secret=pa3zYqUrOB#?secret=Ps1xiwY2Y0" data-secret="Ps1xiwY2Y0" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House Rules Committee voted along party lines to send the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1377" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the full House. If approved, the task force would be charged, in part, with determining whether VMI should continue receiving public funds as a state-sponsored military college.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt, whose district includes VMI, voted against the measure but said he would participate constructively if it moves forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know VMI has had its challenges in the past. I know there have been mistakes made in the past at VMI, and I know that I, myself, as a legislator representing VMI, is willing to carry the (mantle) forward, to make certain that we correct those problems,” Austin said. “And whatever this study produces, we’ll do our very best to adhere and amend to that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin emphasized he wants to preserve VMI’s status as the oldest state-supported military institution in the nation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public comments to the committee leaned heavily against the proposal, with alumni and parents urging lawmakers to maintain state support and pursue reforms without questioning VMI’s continued existence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen Johnson, a VMI alumnus and father of a current cadet, said lawmakers should focus on improvement rather than undermining the institution’s legitimacy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“VMI today is not defined by the nineteenth century or by the choices of earlier generations; it is defined by the young men and women it educates now, the standards it enforces now, and the leaders it produces for Virginia and the nation,” Johnson wrote in a letter obtained by The Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several parents said the proposal has already created uncertainty among cadets and families, particularly over the possibility that VMI could lose state funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michaela Smithley said her son chose VMI to follow his father’s legacy of service but fears the proposal threatens the stability of his education. She warned that transferring governance to another institution with a different mission would fundamentally alter VMI’s identity and set a precedent that any institution may lose its autonomy when it becomes politically inconvenient. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after the start of the session, Del. Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach, introduced </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1374" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1374</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to dissolve VMI’s governing board and transfer oversight to Virginia State University’s Board of Visitors, who represent a historically Black college, close to 160 miles away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My child — and thousands like him — are not abstractions in a policy debate,” Smithley wrote in her public comment to lawmakers. “They are students who have already committed to serve, to lead, and to uphold the values of the commonwealth. They deserve stability, fairness, and confidence that the state they serve will not dismantle the institution they chose in good faith.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another parent, identifying herself only as “Menders,” testified that her son, a current cadet, called her in tears, worried he would be unable to afford his degree if VMI were to lose public funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are begging you to not change the education at VMI,” she wrote to lawmakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other written testimony reflected more mixed views. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erin Tiede and Fred Fenster, parents of a gay cadet, said their daughter has not experienced discrimination and is evaluated solely on character and performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former cadets Jeremiah Woods and Travis Korhorn offered sharply different assessments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woods, who is Black, supported the bill, citing racial targeting, a hostile environment and VMI’s continued glorification of Confederate identity. He said he left the school after his research related to a memorial for enslaved African Americans was suppressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Korhorn also backed the proposal, saying unresolved issues related to racism and sexism warrant formal review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“VMI has some culture issues relating to racism and sexism,” Korhorn said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand there was initiatives undertaken within the last few years to address these issues, but I am not privy to successes or shortcomings. I think HB 1377 would be a good initiative to review the aforementioned initiatives and provide recommendations for further improvement to the school.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force bill is one of several measures aimed at VMI this session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, who sponsored HB 1377, is also carrying </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB22" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 22</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would align VMI with policies used at other public universities by limiting disciplinary immunity for students who report acts of sexual violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither Feggans’ or Helmer’s bills had not been docketed as of Tuesday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feb. 17 is the final day the House can consider legislation that originated in the chamber. If approved by the House, the measures would advance to the Senate and, if passed there, to Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s desk.</span></p>

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia Beach and Rob Wittman of Westmoreland joined seven other members of Congress in pressing the administration of President Donald Trump for answers after a federal decision to pause offshore wind development, including Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://d12t4t5x3vyizu.cloudfront.net/kiggans.house.gov/uploads/2026/01/Final-Letter-on-Offshore-Wind-Pause-01-22-2026.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, the lawmakers called for greater transparency around the 90-day halt, which the Department of Interior said was prompted by national security concerns detailed in confidential reports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We respectfully request additional information on the analysis underlying the recent decision, including how radar interference, environmental tradeoffs, long-term subsidy exposure, workforce impacts, and broader national security considerations were assessed,” the letter read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s $11.2 billion project is nearing completion, with the first power expected to be delivered to the grid by the end of March, even with the temporary pause. Construction on the wind turbines resumed after nearly three weeks when a federal judge allowed work to move forward while court proceedings continue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initial order suggested the turbines could pose potential radar interference. In their letter, the lawmakers asked for the “evidence-based evaluation” that led officials to determine the pause was necessary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once finished, the 176-turbine project is expected to deliver 2.6 gigawatts of power to the grid — enough to supply more than 660,000 homes — at a time when Virginia faces growing energy demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion has installed the first blades on the first full-scale turbine, beyond the two pilot  turbines installed in 2020. The company has repeatedly said the project was thoroughly reviewed for national security concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The project has been more than 10 years in the works, involved close coordination with the military, and is located 27 to 44 miles offshore, so far offshore it does not raise visual impact concerns. The project’s two pilot turbines have been operating for five years without causing any impacts to national security,” Dominion said in a statement following the 90-day pause announcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawmakers warned that additional delays to offshore wind projects nearing completion could threaten jobs and undermine grid reliability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Completing these projects according to plan is essential to achieving American energy dominance and strengthening our national security by reducing reliance on energy produced by our adversaries,” the letter said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Offshore wind is also a critical component of the broader energy capacity needed to support advanced manufacturing and data infrastructure, including winning the artificial intelligence race.”</span></p>

(Photo by Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not easy to be a farmer in Virginia. Pests, weather, uncertain markets and access to capital are a perennial problem. This year farmers have also had to contend with disruptions from President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs, and an immigration crackdown that has deprived many farms of their experienced labor force. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then there’s climate change and the outward creep of suburban sprawl. No wonder </span><a href="https://www.coopercenter.org/research/farming-virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies show</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the number of farms in Virginia continuing to shrink, and the age of farmers still in business trending steadily upward. We are </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-03-11/virginia-has-lost-thousands-family-owned-farms-since-2017" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">losing our family farms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why I’m baffled by the resistance to solar in many parts of rural Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farmers who lease part of their land for solar earn a guaranteed, stable income for 25 or 30 years, keep the property in the family, and never have to watch as a subdivision paves over the fields where they played as children. The income from a solar project will be there when a late frost means the loss of that year’s fruit crop or a scorching summer reduces the corn harvest by half.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, these days the choice is not between farming and solar; farming and solar are increasingly compatible “crops.” Sheep grazing has gotten the most attention in Virginia for its perfect synergy with solar: the sheep thrive in the shade of the solar panels and do the work of vegetation management, which otherwise would require herbicides and machinery. Elsewhere, farmers are raising </span><a href="https://www.cfra.org/blog/harnessing-power-cattle-voltaics-huwa-enterprises-combines-solar-cattle-grazing#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20ran%202%2C000%2Dpound%20bulls,monitoring%20by%20farmers%20and%20ranchers." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cattle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.nffn.org.uk/resources/how-solar-panels-pay-off-for-cumbrian-free-range-egg-farm#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSolar%20panels%20fit%20well%20with,move%20big%20machinery%20around%20them.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poultry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://ag.colorado.gov/blog-post/from-frost-protection-to-energy-generation-the-promise-of-vitivoltaics#:~:text=A%20decade%2Dlong%20vision%20to,hail%20while%20also%20generating%20power." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grapevines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and shade-loving </span><a href="https://www.jackssolargarden.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under solar, in a practice collectively known as agrivoltaics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combination of solar and agriculture is spreading rapidly across the country, endorsed by organizations like the </span><a href="https://farmland.org/smart-solar" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Farmland Trust</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Solar sheep grazing is so popular that it has its own trade association, the </span><a href="https://solargrazing.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Solar Grazing Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Here in Virginia, at least two sheep grazing companies contract with large solar developers for vegetation management. One, </span><a href="https://grayslambscaping.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gray’s Lambscaping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has over 800 sheep at solar projects, and expects to scale up to 5500 sheep by 2028. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the conservation group Piedmont Environmental Council (PEC), which typically opposes large solar projects, is </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/15/can-farmland-thrive-with-solar-this-virginia-nonprofit-is-finding-out/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demonstrating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the feasibility of growing vegetables under solar panels at a community farm in Loudoun County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If solar integrates so well into the agricultural economy, what is the reasoning behind the county ordinances that ban solar or limit it to only a few projects? And why, when a county doesn’t prohibit solar outright, do local leaders so frequently </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/03/data-centers-approved-solar-farms-rejected-what-is-going-on-in-rural-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reject permits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for projects that meet all their conditions?  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve received emails from solar haters who regurgitate misinformation about the harms of solar panels, I’ve listened to legislators wax eloquent on the subject of “protecting rural values,” and I’ve sighed in frustration at a few fellow members of the environmental community who, when it comes to it, care less about addressing climate change than about keeping viewsheds pretty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often the opposition to solar is couched in terms of defending local control of land use decisions. But too many localities use this authority, not to make sure projects are developed responsibly, but to make sure they aren’t developed at all. And to that end, they prevent landowners from using their land in the way the owners have decided they need to. The rejections don’t mean the land returns to being farmed; more likely it means the land will be sold and, quite likely, developed for housing or even – gah! – data centers. If localities cared about saving farmland, they would approve more solar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last year, the percentage of utility solar projects that receive permits from localities </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2025/12/01/virginias-solar-trends-have-changed-approvals-are-up-denials-are-down/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ticked up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> slightly. One possibility is that the hostility to solar is easing. That would be welcome, but I suspect the more likely reason is that solar companies aren’t pursuing projects where they expect rejection. That’s a loss all around: the localities lose out on tax revenue, their landowners lose out on income, and everyone loses out on low-cost electricity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hostility to solar makes little sense to me. Conservatives who care about property rights typically favor landowners over the government, so why is solar different? To be fair, some conservatives actively support solar, such as the groups </span><a href="https://cleanenergyconservatives.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservatives for Clean Energy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://energyrightus.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy Right</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side of the political spectrum, liberals and everyone else who cares about climate change should want solar everywhere – and most do, but not all. As for solar and farming, those of any political persuasion who care about farmland preservation should favor solar over subdivisions. And anyone who cares about the farmers themselves should be spreading the gospel of solar. Agrivoltaics is just the icing on the cake that can make everyone feel they didn’t have to compromise.</span></p>
<p><strong>     <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The legislative response</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators have struggled with this problem for several years now. Many are desperate for new clean energy projects to serve the fast-rising demand for electricity, but they’ve been unable to bring themselves to take authority away from recalcitrant localities. It’s a hard needle to thread.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year members of the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR) crafted a multi-part bill designed to give localities all the information they need to make rational decisions about solar permitting, while giving landowners and project developers a right to appeal adverse decisions to the State Corporation Commission (SCC). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That bill failed in committee, and this year only a part of it made it into a bill. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB918" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 918</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, sets up a university consortium to provide expertise and guidance, including on solar siting and permitting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a bill proposed last year by members of the solar industry came closer to passage than the CEUR bill did. The industry bill proposed a suite of rigorous best practices for solar, designed to reassure localities that solar facilities will be good neighbors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the best practices were farm-friendly provisions like using native pollinator plants, screening with native trees, and incorporating grazing animals or farm crops. Localities would not be allowed to ban solar outright, but would have to make decisions on the merits of each proposal. However, nothing in the bill would have required localities to approve these projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The industry bill foundered last year, but this year it is back with the endorsement of CEUR. In its current form, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB711" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 711</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">from Del. Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB347" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 347</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, continues to preserve local decision-making, but localities that deny permits to solar projects must report their reasons to the SCC for inclusion in a public database. SB 347 has already been reported from committee and will be heard by the full Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only one bill this year is directly aimed at helping farmers install solar. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1091" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1091</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Amy Laufer, D-Albermarle, adds half a line to Virginia’s right-to-farm law giving farmers a right to install solar if they also use the same land for agricultural activities like grazing or crops.  The effect of Laufer’s bill is that any farmer who wants to combine solar and farming could do so without having to go get a local permit. (The right-to-farm law does not exempt farmers from other laws, so regulations governing erosion, wetland protection, etc. still apply.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more modest </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB899" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, developed by PEC and carried by Del. Irene Shin, D-Fairfax, defines agrivoltaics and sets up an advisory panel to determine what qualifies, consider possible requirements and limitations, and make recommendations for next year. That’s encouraging, but unfortunately, the bill defines agrivoltaics specifically to exclude “solar energy generation that replaces the farmer&#8217;s primary income.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Counterfactual definitions like this tend to cause problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a farmer has a crop failure, and the farm’s major source of income that year is solar, do they no longer qualify? It also suggests that sheep graziers in the business of using their animals for vegetation management at solar projects – i.e., agrivoltaics – could not use the industry-accepted word to describe what they do. Besides, really, don’t we want all solar projects to incorporate agriculture?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB588" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sen.David Marsden, D-Fairfax, would task the Department of Energy with setting up a committee of experts to develop solar siting criteria and then score the appropriateness of any proposed site for solar. There’s no indication in the bill that the criteria would include a farmer wanting to include solar among their products, but perhaps it could. However, it would not require localities to approve any projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It feels inevitable that the future of solar incorporates farming, and the future of farming may well mean incorporating solar. Whether Virginia’s leaders see this yet or not is another question, but they do have their opportunity this year.</span></p>

A judge on Tuesday struck down a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed lawmakers to redraw congressional districts mid-decade. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Virginia circuit court on Tuesday struck down a proposed constitutional amendment aimed at giving lawmakers the option to redraw congressional districts mid-decade, dealing a major setback to Democratic legislative leaders who say the change is needed to respond to partisan gerrymandering in some Republican-led states and had hoped to put the measure before voters in an April referendum.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Redistricting.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">22-page ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued by the Tazewell County Circuit Court, Judge Jack C. Hurley found that the legislature acted unlawfully </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/31/virginia-senate-approves-mid-decade-redistricting-amendment-in-party-line-vote/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">when it approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the redistricting amendment during a special legislative session days before the Nov. 4 election, concluding that lawmakers exceeded the scope of that session, violated their own procedural rules and failed to comply with constitutional and statutory requirements governing amendments to the Virginia Constitution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the court declared the amendment process “void ab initio,” meaning legally invalid from the outset. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ruling blocks April vote on redistricting amendment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats had planned to </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/generalassembly/2026-01-22/virginia-house-congressional-redistricting-gerrymandering-referendum-torian" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ask voters on April 21</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whether the General Assembly should be allowed, under limited circumstances, to redraw congressional and legislative districts between censuses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, the court ruled that the amendment was improperly adopted and cannot advance to the ballot as scheduled. The judge also barred state election officials from taking further steps to submit the measure to voters unless and until the constitutional requirements are met.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic leaders said they intend to appeal the decision, which they argue improperly blocks voters from weighing in on the proposal. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released Wednesday by Christopher Newport University’s Wason Center for Civic Leadership suggests Virginians hold mixed views on redistricting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While 63% of respondents said they support the state’s current redistricting system, a narrower majority — 51% — said they support or strongly support the proposed constitutional amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit was brought by Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, who also serves as a legislative commissioner on the </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title30/chapter62/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Redistricting Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McDougle and other plaintiffs argued that Democrats </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/29/va-house-pushes-through-last-minute-redistricting-amendment-as-gop-cries-foul/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unlawfully expanded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the scope of a 2024 special session that had been convened by then-Gov. Glenn Youngkin primarily to address budget matters, and that they did so after voting for the amendment process had already begun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In siding with the plaintiffs, the court agreed that while the special session itself was valid, the General Assembly overstepped when it adopted </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20242/HJ6007" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Joint Resolution 6007</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — the resolution proposing the constitutional amendment — because redistricting was not among the matters permitted to be considered during that session under existing House rules and resolutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The special session was allowed to continue, but it did not allow the majority to unilaterally expand the scope of business,” the judge wrote, concluding that lawmakers failed to follow the procedural safeguards they themselves had adopted for calling and conducting a special session.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Court cites timing, notice failures under state Constitution</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling also focused on the timing of the amendment’s passage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the Virginia Constitution, proposed amendments must be approved by two separately elected General Assemblies, with an intervening general election for the House of Delegates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court found that the amendment was improperly advanced during the 2024 special session and that actions taken during the 2026 regular session could not retroactively cure those defects or satisfy the “next ensuing general election” requirement set out in the constitution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the court held that state officials failed to comply with a Virginia statute requiring public posting of proposed constitutional amendments at courthouses and other public locations at least three months before the next general election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because that posting did not occur, the court said election officials are prohibited from submitting the amendment to voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taken together, the court concluded that “any and all matters, motions, actions or votes regarding House Joint Resolution 6007” violated the General Assembly’s own rules and were therefore illegal.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP, allies call decision a victory for rule of law</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans and allied advocacy groups hailed the decision as a rebuke of what they described as a partisan end-run around constitutional safeguards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a joint statement, McDougle and former U.S. House Speaker Eric Cantor, the honorary co-chair of </span><a href="https://vafairmaps.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians for Fair Maps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said the ruling vindicated their argument that Democrats ignored clear legal limits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today’s ruling is a decisive victory for the rule of law and Virginia voters,” the statement said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The court confirmed that Democrat legislative leaders unlawfully expanded a special session, violated their own rules, and attempted to force through a redistricting constitutional amendment while Virginians were already voting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judge, they added, “rightly declared those actions void” from the start. “If they continue to move forward with the unconstitutional amendment process, the Democrats would be defying the order of the court.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement emphasized the GOP’s position that the case was “never about partisanship,” but rather about process and constitutional compliance. “The court made clear that elections matter, notice matters, and the rules apply to everyone — even those in power,” McDougle and Cantor said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats blast ruling, promise to appeal</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic leaders, however, sharply criticized the ruling and signaled they would fight it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/23/house-speaker-calls-virginia-lawmakers-back-to-richmond-as-possible-redistricting-fight-brews/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called lawmakers back</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Richmond for the special session in October, accused Republicans of using the courts to block a policy they could not defeat politically and said the General Assembly would appeal immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing that happened today will dissuade us from continuing to move forward and put this matter directly to the voters,” Scott said in a statement. “Republicans who can’t win at the ballot box are abusing the legal process in an attempt to sow confusion and block Virginians from voting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott called the lawsuit “court-shopping, plain and simple,” and said Democrats are “prepared for the next step.” “Voters — not politicians — will have the final say,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Hurley was appointed to the court by former Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocacy groups aligned with Democrats echoed that message, framing the ruling as a temporary obstacle rather than a final outcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keren Charles Dongo, campaign manager for </span><a href="https://vafairelections.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians for Fair Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said she expected the decision to be appealed and warned that the ruling could mislead voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a clear attempt to confuse voters and block them from having a say,” Dongo said. “Republicans court-shopped for a ruling because litigation and misinformation are the only tools they have left.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dongo added: “We’re prepared for what comes next, and Virginians deserve both the right to vote and the chance to level the playing field.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amendment at the center of the dispute grew out of Democratic concerns about efforts in some Republican-led states </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/15/nx-s1-5567801/supreme-court-louisiana-redistricting-voting-rights-act" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to redraw congressional maps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, moves that party leaders have linked to pressure from former President Donald Trump and warned could reshape the national political landscape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Virginia voters approved a constitutional amendment creating a bipartisan redistricting commission to draw legislative and congressional maps. When that commission deadlocked in 2021, the task fell to the Virginia Supreme Court, which adopted maps that Republicans have largely defended and Democrats have criticized as more favorable to the GOP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, Democrats in the newly organized legislature </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/16/virginia-senate-democrats-advance-mid-decade-redistricting-amendment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">for a second time advanced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the proposed constitutional amendment that would allow the General Assembly, under narrow conditions, to revisit district lines between censuses — for example, if a court invalidates a map or if federal law changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporters argued the amendment would give Virginia a tool to respond more quickly to legal or demographic shifts, rather than locking in maps for a full decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans countered that the proposal would reopen the door to partisan gerrymandering and undermine the intent of the voter-approved redistricting commission. They also warned that Democrats were rushing the amendment through an unusual procedural pathway to get it before voters as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those procedural concerns formed the backbone of McDougle’s lawsuit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court ultimately agreed, finding that while the General Assembly has broad authority to propose constitutional amendments, it must do so in strict compliance with the Virginia Constitution, state law and its own internal rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling does not permanently bar lawmakers from pursuing a redistricting amendment in the future, but it does require them to restart the process in a manner consistent with constitutional timelines and procedural requirements. </span></p>

Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, in May 2024. (Photo courtesy of Dan Helmer campaign)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, has reached a settlement with all parties in a defamation lawsuit he filed more than a year ago, ending a legal battle tied to sexual assault allegations that surfaced days before he finished second in a crowded June 2024 Democratic primary for Virginia’s 10th Congressional District. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit was originally filed against Avram Fechter, Charles King and Lissa Savaglio. Fechter and Savaglio have been involved with the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, while King has served as Savaglio’s attorney. Savaglio was the most recent to settle; the other two defendants reached a settlement </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/democratic-lawmaker-reaches-partial-settlement-in-defamation-case-over-assault-claim/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">late last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original allegation stemmed from an alleged sexual assault by Helmer at a 2018 event, in which he was accused of inappropriately touching Savaglio. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In seeking the defamation suit, Helmer cited refuting evidence that included screenshots of text messages between the two, in which she warned that a “grassroots activist” had asked her about rumors of sexual misconduct and described the claims as “typical Republican tactics.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helmer’s suit also included an image of Savaglio on the night of the alleged incident at a different event, suggesting she was not with Helmer when the purported altercation took place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the time the allegation surfaced,</span><a href="https://www.notus.org/2024-election/virginia-congress-helmer" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> NOTUS reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the alleged incident prompted the Loudoun County Democratic Committee to adopt new policies aimed at  preventing sexual misconduct. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fechter added at the time that no immediate action against Helmer was pursued in 2018 because the alleged victim — later identified as Savaglio — was not yet willing to come forward publicly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delays in reporting sexual assault can be nuanced, with multiple </span><a href="https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1211&amp;context=jj_etds" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicating that the relationship between a survivor and the alleged perpetrator is a common factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Helmer has maintained that the allegations were politically motivated, accusing the defendants of attempting to damage his campaign in favor of his opponent, Suhas Subramanyam, who went on to win the nomination and now serves as the district’s congressman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While we always knew our politics were dirty, the false accusations leveled against me were a new low,” Helmer said in a statement. “They caused immeasurable harm to myself, my wife and my two children.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With settlements now reached with all parties, Helmer&#8217;s statement continued, he believes the defendants acknowledge they would have lost in court had the case gone to trial. An aide for Helmer confirmed that Savaglio agreed to the terms of the settlement and the release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helmer had originally sought $15 million in damages and did not disclose additional terms of the settlement.</span></p>

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic lawmakers on Monday advanced a sweeping slate of gun safety proposals — many of them previously vetoed by former Gov. Glenn Youngkin — as they test whether Virginia’s new Democratic governor, Abigail Spanberger, will take a more favorable view of firearm restrictions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over nearly four hours, the Democratic-led Senate Courts of Justice Committee approved more than half a dozen bills tightening rules on assault-style firearms, gun storage, concealed carry reciprocity, ghost guns and weapons in public spaces, while rejecting the lone Republican proposal that would have increased mandatory minimum sentences for repeat firearm offenses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the votes fell along party lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meeting came </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/20/lobby-day-draws-larger-pro-gun-crowd-as-virginia-democrats-revive-gun-safety-agenda/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exactly one week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after hundreds of gun rights activists gathered around Capitol Square on Martin Luther King Jr. Day for the annual Lobby Day rally, where speakers warned that Democrats were reviving an aggressive gun control agenda after several years of vetoes under Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That rally drew a larger crowd than recent years, reflecting heightened tension as Democrats now control the governor’s office and both chambers of the General Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of time constraints, the committee did not take up an additional package of gun-related proposals that remain pending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip Van Cleave, president of the gun rights group Virginia Citizens Defence League, sharply criticized the committee’s actions, arguing that Democrats were targeting lawful gun owners rather than violent offenders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While Democrats have bills to weaken laws on violent criminals, they like and support every bill that in any way infringes on the ability of law-abiding citizens to protect themselves,” Van Cleave said in an email Monday afternoon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For years Democrats said, ‘No one wants to take your guns, we just want reasonable gun control.’ They do want to take our guns away, and the committee reported out bills that do just that with the most popular long guns in America. There is only one reason that a government would want a disarmed population, and that’s to force their will upon that population.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Assault weapons and large-capacity magazines</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a 9-5 party-line vote, the committee approved </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB749" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 749</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Sen. Saddam Azlan Salim, D-Fairfax, which would prohibit the importation, sale, manufacture, purchase, possession or transfer of assault firearms and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices, with limited exceptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would create Class 1 misdemeanor penalties but would not retroactively criminalize firearms already legally owned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assault firearms manufactured before July 1, 2026, would be exempt, along with antique firearms, permanently inoperable weapons and manually operated firearms. Exceptions would also apply to law enforcement, military use and certain transfers between immediate family members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Currently, there are so many assault weapons in circulation. This approach will gradually take the weapons off the street without retroactively making it a crime to own a weapon that was legally purchased,” Salim said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponents framed the bill as unconstitutional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s the purpose of the Second Amendment. That’s why we have firearms — to fight against a tyrannical government,” said Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg. “And this bill is a direct infringement on the Second Amendment to fight against a tyrannical government.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southwest Virginia resident Carla Poff, speaking against the bill, said, “I find this to be a blank violation of our Second Amendment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporters countered that similar laws have survived legal challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lori Haas of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions noted that the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals recently </span><a href="https://marylandmatters.org/2026/01/21/appeals-court-upholds-most-of-maryland-ban-on-weapons-in-schools-parks-other-public-places/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">upheld Maryland’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stricter assault weapons ban. “I think we’re in good standing constitutionally,” Haas said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Firearms in public college buildings</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee also advanced </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB272" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 272</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, limiting where firearms may be carried in buildings owned or leased by the commonwealth, including public colleges and universities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill narrows an existing exemption so that firearms would be allowed in higher-education buildings only for approved curricular or institutional activities, such as ROTC programs. Violations would be misdemeanors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This bill has been introduced three times, in 2023, 2024, 2025. This is the fourth time,” Deeds said. “It’s passed the Senate, all three times, it passed both houses, and was vetoed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deeds first introduced the legislation following the 2022 </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/18/its-important-to-know-everything-that-led-to-slayings-of-uva-football-players/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Virginia shooting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that killed three students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponents argued the measure would leave students vulnerable. “Students have a right to self defense,” said Eric Nolen, who spoke against the bill.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Safe storage in homes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers approved </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB348" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 348</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, requiring firearms and ammunition to be stored in locked containers when a minor or prohibited person is present in the residence. Violations would be a Class 4 misdemeanor, and dealers would be required to post notices explaining the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every single time I’m carrying this bill, there has been a fatality of a small child,” Boysko said, citing recent shootings involving children in Newport News, Chesterfield County and Norfolk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previous iterations of the bill had twice been vetoed by Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Assault weapons in public spaces</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB312" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 312</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, expanding Virginia’s prohibition on carrying certain semi-automatic firearms in public places, including streets and parks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This was inspired by an incident at the Old Town Farmer’s Market,” Ebbin said, referring to people </span><a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/alexandria/mancarriesassaultweaponthroughfarmersmarket/65-09269ceb-7d51-4bc3-97c7-678ded940d30" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">openly carrying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> assault-style firearms in Alexandria. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also cited the 2017 Charlottesville </span><a href="https://time.com/charlottesville-white-nationalist-rally-clashes/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unite the Right rally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and research showing higher casualty rates in mass shootings involving such weapons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponents argued the bill is overly broad. Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, said it would criminalize most modern pistols and “would not last five minutes under any constitutional scrutiny.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ghost guns and unserialized firearms</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On another party-line vote, lawmakers advanced </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB323" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 323</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also sponsored by Ebbin, targeting so-called ghost guns and unfinished firearm components. The bill would prohibit manufacturing, selling or possessing unserialized firearms or unfinished frames and receivers, with delayed effective dates to allow compliance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This bill is about keeping guns out of the hands of children, or people prohibited from guns, and traffickers,” Ebbin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Weber of the National Rifle Association argued the bill is unworkable, saying, “There is no process set up to acquire a serial number for a firearm.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Firearms left in vehicles and concealed carry reciprocity</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee approved </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB496" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 496,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sponsored by Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, requiring handguns left in unattended vehicles to be stored in locked, hard-sided containers out of view.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is where young people are getting these guns,” Marsden said, citing thefts from vehicles as a major source of illegal firearms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans warned the bill could criminalize victims of theft. Sen. Glenn Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, said it “essentially criminalizes behavior when someone has been robbed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers also passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB115" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 115</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Sen. Stella Pekarsky, D-Fairfax, tightening Virginia’s recognition of concealed handgun permits issued by other states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Basically it says you can’t just go down to Texas and pay a couple bucks and then get a concealed weapon permit all around Virginia,” said Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, the committee chair.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Republican bill rejected</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee defeated </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB78" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 78</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Sen. Danny Diggs, R-York, which would have increased mandatory minimum sentences for repeat firearm offenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What deters crime is knowing you’re going to get caught,” Surovell said, arguing harsher penalties alone are ineffective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the Democratic-backed bills now head to the Senate Finance Committee to determine their fiscal impact.</span></p>

(Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation is advancing through the General Assembly to restrict future data centers to industrially zoned areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several of the bills are aimed at helping localities manage the industry as well as temper community concerns over environmental impacts, sound, and viewshed issues around data centers. One bill looks to place data centers near manufacturers and warehouses – far away from commercial and residential communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we&#8217;re trying to have happen is have localities acknowledge that data centers, especially in the modern day, are not the way that they were just 10 years ago,” Sen. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, said in a local government committee meeting. “But the modern data centers today that are being built up, especially for AI, are industrial use and they need to be classified as such.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roem is the sponsor of </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB94" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 94</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has faced pushback from the data center industry and electrical workers unions. The bill does not stop communities from rezoning areas to be industrial in order to make more space for data centers. Localities often require setbacks and buffers when an industrial zone borders a residential area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roem’s district, which includes parts of Prince William County, is home to over 60 data centers. A recent move to rezone agricultural areas near Manassas National Battlefield for the controversial </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/northern-virginia/judge-blocks-data-center-project-planned-in-prince-william-county/3972855/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Gateway data center project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is caught up in a court battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2024 Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/landing-2024-data-centers-in-virginia.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report on data centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stated that the state should allow localities to manage their own ordinances and siting for the industry. But Roem said that since the report’s release localities have been slow to pass ordinances, and community concern around where data centers are allowed has increased. She said the price of land in her district is skyrocketing due to the data center industry and the energy needed to be built to power them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You basically have data centers outbidding residential developers in much of Northern Virginia … It has localities looking at, will we be able to actually approve residential rezoning for future projects? Will we be able to use the grid, be able to handle that capacity,” said Andrew Clark, vice president of government affairs for the Home Builders Association of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Home Builders Association did not take a stance on the bill, but did answer a question to the committee posed by Roem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data center industry is not a fan of the bill. Nicole Riley with the Data Center Coalition testified against the bill, saying it unfairly targets one industry over other large projects. She pointed to <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB130" target="_blank">Senate Bill 130</a> by Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, that allows localities to require environmental and sound impact studies to be done before approving permits for data centers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe this is the best approach to address the need for localities to have more tools when approving permits related to projects for high energy use facilities,” Riley said in committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill was referred to Senate Finance for further consideration with a vote of 8-5 with one abstention. </span></p>

Smith Hall on the campus of the Virginia Military Institute. (Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation aimed at reshaping Virginia Military Institute’s governance, policies and oversight is gaining momentum, after a House subcommittee last week advanced a bill that could directly affect the state-funded military college’s finances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1377" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would create a task force that, in part, would recommend whether VMI should continue receiving public funds as a state-sponsored institution, amid lawmakers’ concerns about discrimination and institutional culture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, said an investigation is warranted because VMI’s board did not renew the contract of Ret. General Cedric Wins, the institution’s first Black superintendent, and because of unresolved issues following a </span><a href="https://www.schev.edu/home/showpublisheddocument/1905/637919378545470000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 investigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that found persistent disparities, cultural barriers, and a lack of accountability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For those of us, like me, who care deeply about service and care deeply about producing leaders of character, we need to ensure that VMI (has turned the page),” said Helmer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This task force offers a real opportunity to ensure we are inspiring leaders of character who understand the importance of the United States, who understand the history of Virginia, and reject rebellion against the United States, all the more important, at a time when we have a president of the United States and others who seem uninterested in the Constitution of the United States.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opposition emerged during the legislative process. Ret. Lt. Gen. David Furness, VMI’s superintendent, voiced concerns about the bill during an appearance before the House Studies Subcommittee on Jan. 23. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pointed to VMI’s honor system and progress on equity audit recommendations, noting that 34 out of 38 changes have been completed, and objected to claims that VMI’s leadership supports the Lost Cause of the Confederacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is hard for me to understand how the institution lauded for its leadership model by so many notable state and national leaders could be described by the patron of this bill as committed to the Lost Cause of the Confederacy,” Furness said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That may have been true of VMI in the past. It is not now, nor will it be in the future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The subcommittee, which Helmer chairs, voted 4-1 to send the proposal to the House Rules Committee. House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, cast the lone dissenting vote. .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helmer’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB22" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 22</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had not yet been docketed with the House Education Committee, as of Monday at noon. The proposal would align VMI with standard policies used at other public universities regarding disciplinary immunity for students who report acts of sexual violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helmer said it is critical to understand how VMI is responding to the General Assembly’s concerns, particularly around racism, sexism, sexual assault, educational outcomes, and leadership development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Separately, the House Education Committee is expected to consider </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1374" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1374</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would dissolve VMI’s governing board and transfer oversight to Virginia State University’s Board of Visitors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach, the bill&#8217;s patron, said the proposal is intended as a structural — not punitive — response to longstanding governance concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The bill reflects broader, longstanding concerns about whether VMI’s current governance structure meets the standards the commonwealth expects,” Feggans said in a Jan. 21 statement. “When patterns of governance issues arise, it is appropriate for the General Assembly to review and, if necessary, adjust oversight structures.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that the proposal “strengthens oversight, clarifies accountability, and ensures that VMI can focus on its core mission while operating under a governance framework that meets modern expectations for a public institution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the measures clear the House, they would move to the Senate before heading to Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s desk, marking the next steps in the legislative process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, a graduate of both VMI and Virginia State University, has been a vocal critic of the institution’s leadership. However, she said she played no role in the drafting of the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unequivocally, no,” Carroll Foy said. “I had no idea that these bills were drafted, or that anyone was contemplating drafting these bills. I was never consulted about it. I wasn’t even aware that these bills existed until reporters started asking and inquiring about the bill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carroll Foy said VMI’s current predicament stems from decisions made under former Gov. Glenn Youngkin, past governing board members, and the Spirit of VMI PAC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said confidence has eroded among many lawmakers because those parties failed in their fiduciary duties and engaged in partisan political disputes over the institution’s leadership and direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite that history, Carroll Foy described VMI as an “extraordinary place for extraordinary people” and said she believes the institution and Board of Visitors can “turn a page on the path and be forward-looking and produce some of the best citizen soldiers in this country.”</span></p>
<p>Sherry L. Wallace, a VMI spokeswoman, said in a statement, &#8220;We are reviewing all recently filed bills and plan to work with our elected officials to demonstrate VMI’s continued progress and ongoing value to the commonwealth of Virginia. VMI is defined by an uncompromising honor system that is more fair, equitable, and transparent today than at any intime of the Institute’s 186-year history. The citizen-soldiers the Institute educates are the epitome of value, and we plan to continue that mission.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of America&#8217;s last battleships, USS Wisconsin, is moored on the Elizabeth River in Norfolk, Virginia.</p>
<p>Now a floating museum, the ship&#8217;s most recent battle was winning <i>Good Morning America&#8217;s</i> Great Christmas Light Fight this past holiday season.</p>
<p>USS Wisconsin was still decked out in lights when David Woods recently gave a tour of the historic ship. A retired warrant officer, Woods spent 30 years in naval aviation, often working on aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>He said the Wisconsin &#8211; one of four Iowa-Class battleships that entered service in the final months of World War II &#8211; is still intact enough that it can technically be recalled back into service.</p>
<p>&#8220;The little stipulation we have with the Navy: There&#8217;s certain things we can&#8217;t do to the ship as a museum, because they have to be able to take the ship back and undo everything we did within like two or three weeks,&#8221; Woods said.</p>
<p>USS Wisconsin came into service in 1944. It was revived briefly during the Reagan defense buildup in the 1980s, then decommissioned again in the early 1990s after its 16 inch guns were used for shore bombardment in the first Gulf War.</p>
<p>Its 13 inch steel hull is thick enough to withstand a modern tomahawk cruise missile. But operating it would cost nearly $1 million a day just in fuel. With its dials and analog firing systems, the ship would also require a complete retrofit.</p>
<p>Woods said the Wisconsin and other battleships of its era are probably no longer the ships the Navy needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would volunteer to come out of retirement in a heartbeat to serve on one of them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But in modern warfare and feasibility-wise, they&#8217;re just obsolete, unfortunately.&#8221;</p>
<p>Battleships haven&#8217;t been part of the Navy&#8217;s arsenal since the World War II era ships were finally retired. The Navy now relies mainly on smaller, more versatile destroyers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s ships have to be multi-functional,&#8221; Woods said. &#8220;A battleship is a bowie knife; a destroyer is a Swiss army knife.&#8221;</p>
<p>President Donald Trump announced plans in December to revive the battleship concept and build as many as 20 &#8211; 25 new battleships as part of what he&#8217;s calling the &#8220;Golden Fleet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following Trump&#8217;s announcement, the Navy put on hold its plans for a new, more powerful destroyer. Instead, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Daryl Caudle embraced Trump&#8217;s vision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Battleships will anchor maritime fires and sea control in the most contested environments, massing durable combat power and absorbing punishment and adversary cannot match,&#8221; Caudle said in January at the Annual Surface Navy Association National Symposium in Arlington, Virginia.</p>
<p>During the conference, the Congressional Budget Office released an estimate that the first ship could cost as much as $22 billion, while follow ups could cost between $10 to $15 billion.</p>
<p>That would rival the cost of the larger Ford-Class aircraft carriers. USS Gerald F. Ford cost roughly $13 billion after cost overruns and delays.</p>
<p>The design concept of the new ship, which was unveiled during a Trump press conference, has been pulled from the Internet. But the battleship was more than double the length of current destroyers and needed almost three times the crew. It included a number of weapons systems that aren&#8217;t in production.</p>

(Courtesy of U.S. Navy)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Bryan Clark, a senior fellow with the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, expressed concern about the design&#8217;s complexity.</p>
<p>He noted it&#8217;s one thing to say the Navy needs a larger ship which could launch more missiles.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s another thing to say, &#8216;I need to have a laser on it, I need to have a rail gun on it, and other systems that don&#8217;t exist yet and that are going to be too complex to introduce all into one platform without creating a massive increase in cost and schedule,'&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In 2021, the Navy dropped plans for railguns, which fire metal bolts rather than shells, when the program failed to produce a consistently working model.</p>
<p>The Navy has a history of stopping ship production when delays pile up and costs get out of hand. It ended the Zumwalt class of destroyer after three ships. And the Trump Administration just ended production of the Constellation class frigate after the first two ships.</p>
<p>A new battleship could be the costliest U-turn in Navy history.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they end up abandoning it, now you&#8217;ve got these orphan ships that have a lot of unique capabilities that will be difficult to maintain on that small scale,&#8221; Clark said.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Congress will have a say on whether the battleships are built. Even if lawmakers approve the plan, the U.S. won&#8217;t roll out its first battleship since 1944 for at least a decade, Clark said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Abigail Spanberger, sworn in earlier this month as Virginia’s 75th governor, has moved quickly to draw a line between state law enforcement and federal immigration enforcement, while acknowledging that much of the authority still rests outside her control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just hours after taking the oath of office on Jan. 17, Spanberger fulfilled a promise she made in an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/08/27/spanberger-vows-to-scrap-youngkins-immigration-order-if-elected-governor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">August interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with The Mercury, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/17/spanberger-sworn-in-as-virginias-first-woman-governor-moves-swiftly-to-set-agenda/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rescinding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> former Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Executive Order 47. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order had directed Virginia State Police and the Department of Corrections to enter into so-called </span><a href="https://www.ice.gov/identify-and-arrest/287g" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">287(g) agreements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, effectively deputizing state officers to assist with federal immigration enforcement and encouraging local cooperation with ICE to identify and remove noncitizens accused or convicted of crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger’s executive action marked a sharp policy reversal after years of Republican leadership in Richmond and came as immigration enforcement has intensified in blue states under President Donald Trump’s renewed push for large-scale deportations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My executive order, repealing Executive Order 47, was an important first step in ensuring that we are not moving or reallocating state and local resources away from the first-responder duties, whether it is investigating crimes or being ready to support a community in need,” Spanberger said last week. </span></p>

Abigail Spanberger addresses the media ahead of a winter storm and answered questions about her immigration enforcement stance on Jan. 22, 2026. (Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She emphasized the prior order “had created some real challenges.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ultimately, I am looking to every step forward that we can take as a commonwealth to ensure that our communities are safe and protected,” Spanberger continued, adding that confusion around law enforcement authority has fueled fear in immigrant communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Frankly, the fear and concern that we’ve seen in other places where people without any sort of designation — unannounced, wearing masks — are taking people off the streets, the level of fear that that’s created and the level of distrust and confusion is certainly not contributing to any strengthening of our communities, let alone keeping our communities safer.”</span></p>
<p>On Friday, members of Virginia’s Service Employees International Union chapters gathered outside a U.S. federal courthouse in Richmond to protest ICE enforcement, underscoring growing opposition from labor and immigrant advocates.</p>
<p>About 50 people attended the demonstration, where speakers criticized federal detention practices and read aloud the names of individuals who have been killed during ICE operations over the past year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We<span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span>re seeing the ICE escalate everywhere from from Minneapolis all the way here to Richmond,&#8221; said Violeta Vega, an SEIU member serving as an emcee for the gathering.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">State action, limited reach</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Spanberger’s order ends the requirement that state agencies enter into 287(g) agreements, it does not terminate existing contracts between ICE, state and local governments, regional jails or sheriffs’ offices. Nor does it prohibit new agreements at the local level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All state and local agreements “remain in force until terminated” by one or both parties, a new </span><a href="https://www.justice4all.org/what-we-do/immigration/ICEcontracts/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal Aid Justice Center analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found. There has been no evidence to date that any existing contracts between ICE and state or local law enforcement have been ended as a result of the governor’s action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report details how dozens of agencies across Virginia — including state agencies and regional jails — have contracted with ICE to perform duties that may exceed their authority or conflict with state law and the Virginia Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The analysis further found that at least 223 state and local personnel have been nominated to participate in 287(g) agreements, including two school resource officers and a behavioral health advocate. One facility — the Riverside Regional Jail in Prince George County — receives more than half of its revenue from holding people for ICE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those local law enforcement agencies with 287(g) agreements now have a massive financial incentive to abandon their mission to protect communities in favor of terrorizing immigrant populations,” said Alex Kornya, LAJC’s director of litigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Contracts with ICE, often shrouded in secrecy, are not only a misuse of time and resources, but they also open these agencies up to significant liability, liability that Virginia taxpayers will ultimately pay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LAJC said many of the agreements were negotiated quietly, with agencies declining to provide information in response to public records requests — in some cases saying ICE instructed them not to respond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to ICE’s </span><a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ice.gov%2Fdoclib%2Fabout%2Foffices%2Fero%2F287g%2FparticipatingAgencies01162026am.xlsx&amp;wdOrigin=BROWSELINK" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">own website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are currently at least 32 active 287(g) agreements in Virginia involving the state and local governments, and correctional facilities. Five are with state agencies, while the remainder involve local law enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICE did not respond to a request for comment from The Mercury.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Fear, trust and public safety</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Civil rights groups, including LAJC, say the impact of these agreements extends beyond immigration enforcement, undermining trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Governor Spanberger’s action to rescind EO 47 on her first day was an important step, as these contracts do nothing to make people safer,” said Rohmah Javed, legal director of LAJC’s Immigrant Justice Program, adding that immigrant communities across the state are terrified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These agreements erode trust, making it much less likely immigrants will seek out needed services, report crimes witnessed or crimes they have experienced as victims, or participate in their communities,” Javed said. “But we need to see immediate action at both the state and local levels to officially end these abusive agreements.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ACLU of Virginia called the order a first step toward ensuring state law enforcement is not used for federal immigration enforcement, while cautioning that existing contracts and federal authority remain unchanged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Governor Spanberger’s executive order recognizes that blurring the line between Virginia law enforcement and federal immigration agents not only diverts Virginia resources away from public safety priorities, but erodes public trust by terrorizing communities and breaking apart families,” ACLU of Virginia Executive Director Mary Bauer said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Republicans warn repeal of ICE order threatens public safety</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia GOP leaders, meanwhile, sharply criticized Spanberger’s decision, arguing that rescinding Youngkin’s order weakens cooperation with federal authorities and threatens public safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin himself told The Mercury in an interview earlier this month that rescinding his Executive Order 47 would be “a huge mistake,” calling it a necessary tool for combating violent crime and gang activity, particularly in Northern Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That partnership has made Virginia safer. We arrested the number-three guy in MS-13; the number three guy in MS-13 was just living in Virginia that otherwise would have never been arrested,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/JasonMiyaresVA/status/2012635213247947099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2012635213247947099%7Ctwgr%5E921bb8a3cd066e67082fed723b54b320a815a7d8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwjla.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Fgovernor-abigail-spanberger-virginia-commonwealth-richmond-inauguration-rescinds-gov-glenn-youngkins-state-police-ice-affordability-education-immigration-attorney-general-jay-jones-lt-governor-ghazala-hashmi-general-assembly-trump-immigrants-ice" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a post on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, formerly Twitter, former Attorney General Jason Miyares called Spanberger’s move “a disaster for the public safety” of the commonwealth. “Mark my words, there will be Virginians who will be robbed, raped and murdered as a result of this anti public safety executive order. No one should be surprised.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, </span><a href="https://katv.com/news/nation-world/virginia-gop-lawmakers-react-to-abigail-spanberger-order-ending-cooperation-with-ice-republicans-democrats-immigration-glenn-youngkin" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also warned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that ending mandated cooperation with ICE could lead to increased crime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Folks need to be able to walk their street at night without fear of being either shot or kidnapped or raped. It’s the wrong way to move with public safety in Virginia,” Kilgore said. “When Governor Youngkin had the agreement, we were able to catch all those MS-13 gang members up in Northern Virginia. If we’re not cooperating with ICE, folks are going to get harmed in Virginia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, federal data show that immigrants without criminal records now make up the largest share of people held in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, despite repeated assertions by some political leaders that enforcement is focused primarily on violent offenders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.cato.org/news-releases/new-data-73-ice-detainees-have-no-criminal-record" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICE’s own figures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, roughly 73% of those in detention as of late 2025 had no criminal conviction, and only a small fraction were held for violent offenses — many others had only minor or civil immigration offenses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, too, officials have not substantiated claims about the criminal histories of people rounded up by the state’s task force. Last summer, Youngkin claimed his administration had arrested more than 2,500 immigrants who were </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/07/02/they-should-be-arrested-youngkin-holds-firm-on-support-for-ice-raids-at-virginia-courthouses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“violent criminals,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but Miyares at the time </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/07/23/miyares-offers-no-proof-that-2500-immigrants-arrested-by-va-task-force-were-violent-offenders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declined to provide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> evidence that those individuals were in fact violent offenders when pressed by The Mercury. </span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Local leaders respond</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Richmond, Mayor Danny Avula — the city’s first immigrant mayor — issued a statement addressing community concerns following reports of ICE activity in the region, including recent activity in </span><a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/11/03/making-virginia-safe-again-ice-arrests-sexual-predators-drug-traffickers-and" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.12onyourside.com/2026/01/15/alleged-sighting-ice-petersburg-least-two-people-detained/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand there is tremendous fear in the community right now,” Avula said. “Fear in completing everyday tasks, such as showing up for work, taking your children to school, or buying groceries, and I want you to know I hear you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avula emphasized that Richmond does not coordinate with ICE on deportation activities and that the Richmond Police Department has not entered into a 287(g) agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our officers are here to focus on their core mission: community policing, protecting all neighborhoods, and reducing crime,” Avula said, urging residents to call 911 if they need law enforcement assistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I reject any approach that creates fear, confusion, or division,” he added. “Those tactics undermine public safety and erode trust, making our communities less safe, not more secure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, immigration enforcement concerns intensified last week after Hanover County officials </span><a href="https://www.hanovercounty.gov/m/newsflash/home/detail/1069" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">confirmed receiving a letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security outlining plans to purchase and operate an ICE processing facility in a warehouse on Lakeridge Parkway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">County officials said the project was not initiated by Hanover and that the county has 30 days to respond. The Board of Supervisors had not convened to discuss the proposal as of Thursday and is expected to address the matter at its Jan. 28 meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia currently has two major long-term ICE detention centers — the Farmville Detention Center and the Caroline Detention Facility — along with regional jails that hold detainees under contract, including the Virginia Peninsula Regional Jail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocacy groups say any expansion of processing or detention capacity could deepen fear in surrounding communities.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A broader political test</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The debate over federal immigration enforcement underscores a broader challenge for Democratic governors in states where ICE activity remains governed largely by federal authority and locally negotiated contracts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Minnesota, Gov. Tim Walz publicly condemned a federal immigration operation in Minneapolis that sparked widespread protest after a federal agent </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/07/repub/ice-officer-fatally-shoots-driver-through-car-window-in-minneapolis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fatally shot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 37-year old woman through her car window earlier this month. Following the killing, </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-walz-says-minnesota-must-play-a-role-in-investigation-into-ices-killing-of-renee-good" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walz demanded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the state must play a role in the investigation of the incident. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coverage of the fallout has highlighted the limited tools Democratic governors have to rein in enforcement carried out independently by ICE or through local arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar tensions have surfaced in Illinois and Massachusetts, where Democratic governors back sanctuary-style policies but continue to face criticism when ICE makes arrests in jails and courthouses governed by local practices rather than state law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Illinois, confusion over the state’s TRUST Act has left sheriffs and the governor </span><a href="https://www.mystateline.com/news/local-news/four-illinois-sheriffs-offices-defied-sanctuary-laws-transfered-immigrants-to-ice-report/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">caught between</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> immigrant advocates and federal officials. In Massachusetts, renewed attention to ICE courthouse arrests has put Gov. Maura Healey </span><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/09/07/metro/massachusetts-ice-immigration-raid-sanctuary-boston/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">under pressure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to respond to enforcement decisions she does not control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Against that backdrop, Spanberger has emphasized that the stakes in Virginia are about trust — particularly whether immigration enforcement policies discourage people from calling police when they need help.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ultimately, how we will determine how Virginia proceeds is that — and I say this as someone who grew up in a law enforcement family and began my career in law enforcement — the idea that any community member would be afraid of calling police in a time of need, if there’s an emergency in their home, is a tragedy in and of itself,” Spanberger said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB83" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, carried by Del. Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach, would authorize the Virginia Information Technologies Agency to select people to serve as Virginia Cyber Civilian Corps volunteers and corps advisors, and to deploy such volunteers across the commonwealth to provide rapid-response assistance under the direction of VITA upon request from a client, or government agency, affected by a cybersecurity incident. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal would also create an advisory board within VITA to review and make recommendations regarding the creation and administration of the corps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes as public data suggests cyber attacks are increasing. In many cases, reporting lags and transparency vary due to reputational or security concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem today is that localities are ‘soft targets’ these days,” said Tijay Chung, an associate professor in the computer science department at Virginia Tech. “Hackers have shifted (their) focus from hard and corporate targets to schools, hospitals or municipalities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB83" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 83</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a smart idea and that hackers are aware that local governments don’t have the budgets for a state-of-the-art security system or dedicated 24/7 monitoring teams.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s why these days hackers, in my opinion, think that (attacking) localities are easy targets —  low risk, high reward,” Chung added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2024, Feggans introduced a similar </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB651" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which cleared the General Assembly during his first term. However, former Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed the bill. Youngkin believed creating a civilian cybersecurity corps is premature, costly and legally unclear under Virginia’s current cybersecurity setup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Department of Planning and Budget, an </span><a href="https://lis.blob.core.windows.net/files/1091372.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $410,000 is projected for the Virginia Information Technology Agency to create and fund an advisory board for the Virginia Cyber Civilian Corps. Funds would also be allocated to the Virginia State Police for fingerprinting volunteers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feggans’ interest in introducing the legislation stems from his time as a cybersecurity intern for former Gov. Terry McAuliffe&#8217;s administration and their research on potential legislation. He also saw the success of similar proposals in other states like Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This wasn&#8217;t just something that came up out of the blue,” Feggans said at the start of the General Assembly session. “It&#8217;s a model showing that we can increase our cybersecurity resources without adding a large bill to the state. We&#8217;ve seen cyber attacks happen in Virginia, and we just need to continue to increase our intellectual abilities to be able to assist in that, and this is my way to address our cybersecurity resources within the state.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December, Campbell County was targeted by a cyberattack on its emergency notification system, OnSolve CodeRed, for weather and emergency alerts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The county says the system has been decommissioned. An initial investigation found that an organized cybercriminal group damaged the CodeRED platform. The group may have removed subscriber data and posted some of it online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chung said lawmakers will need to consider vetting volunteer experts in their implementation plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chung said that having a certification does not necessarily mean you can stop an active ransomware attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You really have to have real experience. Conversely, some of the best white hat hackers may not have a formal degree. VITA needs to balance bureaucracy with actual technical capability.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Feggans’ bill is to have any success in passing to the Senate, it will have to clear the House of Delegates before crossover on Feb. 18. Gov. Abigail Spanberger would be responsible for signing the legislation.</span></p>

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incarcerated people in Virginia can contact their friends and family by phone call or a special email service for prisons, but those who previously served time say in-person visits helped them keep morale high and incentivized good behavior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former and current inmates and criminal justice advocates are calling for clearer visitation standards in Virginia facilities, a challenge a new legislative measure is designed to address.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB173" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 173</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Bonita Anthony, D-Norfolk, would require that the Virginia Department of Corrections provide extended visitation access for long-distance travelers who live at least 150 miles outside of the correctional facility, minors under 18 years old, and infrequent visitors who have not been to see their loved one in more than 90 days. Each visit for these types of guests would be at least two hours, unless the visitor or inmate requests to shorten it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the standards become applied broadly to VADOC, the bill stipulates that the department conduct pilot programs of the revised visitation rules at three or more prisons with different security levels to evaluate the staffing and safety impacts. This will help the department sort through how to best implement the new visitation standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill also outlines how visitation privileges could only be suspended for conduct occurring during the visitation that “presents a direct and substantial threat to the physical safety of participants or the security of the correctional facility.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, it would create an appeal process for suspension of visitation rights and would require VADOC to collect and publish related data in an annual report to state lawmakers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caroline Via, whose husband Blake was previously incarcerated at Dilwyn Correctional Center, said she has been turned away when trying to visit him due to her attire, despite her attempts to follow the visitation rules and clothing policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VADOC </span><a href="https://vadoc.virginia.gov/family-and-friends/visiting-an-inmate/#:~:text=Dress%20Code,to%20enter%20the%20visiting%20room." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policy outlines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that clothing must cover people from neck to kneecap, must not contain &#8220;inappropriate language or graphics,” watches and other wearable technology are prohibited, and that administrative duty officers “will make the final decision” on whether or not someone is allowed into the visitor room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what she wore, Caroline said occasionally authorities at the center told her she needed to change for security reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, she’d “run to the nearest store and get something because I don’t want to skip my visit,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After several such interactions, she said she didn’t always bring the couple’s young son along to the facility, an hour and a half from their home, concerned that he would “get his hopes up,&#8221; only to not see his father. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another time, Blake said his visitation privileges were at risk of being revoked because apparently he and Caroline shared too long of a kiss. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s inconsistent with treatment between (correctional officers’) shifts,” Blake said, adding that Anthony’s bill could help create consistent standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humanization Project co-founder Taj Mahon-Haft also supports the bill. The organization, spearheaded by formerly incarcerated people like himself, advocates to the state legislature on behalf of bills like Anthony’s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During Mahon-Haft’s incarceration his mother and his now-wife were two of the people he was in touch with most, each leaning on the other for emotional support. With his mother living in New Mexico, she saved up money and took time off work to visit at least twice a year. This entailed paying for flights, a hotel and a rental car. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In late 2021, as COVID-19 pandemic restrictions were easing up, Mahon-Haft said he’d filled out the required documentation to arrange for his mother to visit him. She was told to leave the prison after just an hour, he said, despite the waiting room being empty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the last time she visited him before he was released. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She couldn’t put herself through that again,” he said. “She’d spent thousands of dollars, come thousands of miles and wasted five days of her PTO.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and the Vias feel that the treatment by prison staff has “basically discouraged away visits” at times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthony’s bill must work its way through various committees before it may clear both chambers of the legislature and ultimately face Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s final approval, amendments or rejection. </span></p>

(Photo by Vicki Jauron, Babylon and Beyond Photography via Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Menhaden, the controversial oily fish, are making waves early in the General Assembly legislative session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three bills have been filed that would curb menhaden catches by the only reduction fishery allowed in the Chesapeake Bay and to study the population, which some conservation groups have said is declining in the Bay and spurring suffering among other species. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocean Harvesters, which contracts with Omega Protein, is a purse seine reduction fishery in Reedville, Virginia. They are the only reduction fishery allowed in the Bay, as surrounding states have banned that kind of industrial scale fishing. They frequently are blamed for the challenges posed to the menhaden population within the Bay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservationists have been sounding the alarm over </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/10/study-shows-osprey-chicks-are-starving-conservationists-question-connection-to-menhaden-fishing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">starving osprey populations, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">which researchers use as a proxy for menhaden as they are a key part of the birds’ diets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maryland members of the Atlantic Menhaden Management Board have also claimed that fewer menhaden have been able to travel up to their shores for fishermen to harvest in years past, a point that Ocean Harvesters has fiercely denied and said data does not support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Betsy Carr, D-Richmond, sponsored </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1048" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1048</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would halt all purse seine fishing of menhaden in the Virginia portion of the Chesapeake Bay until it can be scientifically proven that the fishery does not negatively impact other fisheries or species that depend on the forage fish to survive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocean Harvesters said that broad language could mean the fishery shutters permanently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The cost would be real and immediate in the Northern Neck, where these measures threaten hundreds of jobs for fishermen and plant workers, along with paychecks, benefits, and health insurance in a rural region with few comparable, full-benefit alternatives,” Ocean Harvesters said. “These bills would disproportionately hit a largely minority, union workforce and punish working families while ignoring the science-based management already in place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carr’s other bill, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1049" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1049</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would implement quota periods so that the amount the fishery is allowed to harvest, which is already limited by a specific cap of 51,000 metric tons, would be spaced out over certain times so that the menhaden could potentially move through the Bay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal is similar to a suggestion by the Maryland representative in the menhaden management board, which opted to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/30/menhaden-management-board-votes-to-reduce-2026-catch-quota-for-entire-east-coast/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restrict menhaden harvests by 20% along the entire East Coast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“HB 1049 goes further than the Maryland delegation proposal by restricting rollover of unused quota between periods and layering on an observer requirement for a portion of trips, which are additional operational burdens without a clear conservation payoff,” Ocean Harvesters said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carr could not be reached for comment on her bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly has attempted and failed to pass legislation in the past to conduct a Bay- specific study on the menhaden populations. There’s another attempt on the docket this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. David Marsden, D-Fairfax, proposed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB474" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 474</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to establish the Atlantic Menhaden Research Fund to be used by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science to conduct the menhaden population study and report to the General Assembly each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Directly and indirectly, menhaden are essential to the livelihoods of countless Virginia small businesses, families, and communities. Responsibly managing the fishery protects the menhaden industry’s own workers, who have the most to lose if the fishery collapses,” said Will Poston, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation forage campaign manager.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three bills have not yet come up for hearings in the General Assembly. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The search is part of Virginia Attorney General Jay Jones’ promise to take politics out of higher education and defend Virginia’s students by recruiting and hiring talented legal professionals. Jones was sworn into office, along with Gov. Abigail Spanberger and Lt. Gov. Ghazala Hashmi, last Saturday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The positions are at the </span><a href="https://www.jobs.virginia.gov/jobs/university-counsel-chief-legal-officer-university-of-virginia-charlottesville-virginia-united-states?lApplicationSubSourceID=" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.jobs.virginia.gov/jobs/university-counsel-chief-legal-officer-george-mason-university-fairfax-virginia-united-states?lApplicationSubSourceID=" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Mason University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.jobs.virginia.gov/jobs/institute-counsel-virginia-military-institute-lexington-virginia-united-states?lApplicationSubSourceID=" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Military Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all of which have been subject to federal scrutiny for their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, as U.S. Department of Education leaders attempt to align higher education institutions nationwide with the policies of President Donald Trump’s administration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UVA and George Mason have been the subject of multiple federal investigations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia’s world-class institutions of higher education are integral to spurring innovation, building the workforce of today and tomorrow, and driving economic growth,” said Attorney General Jay Jones in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Trump administration’s “continued politically-motivated assaults” on Virginia’s academic institutions have sought to “tarnish their reputations and undermine their ability to successfully prepare our students for the future” over the past year, Jones said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginians made it clear this past November that they want leaders who will fight back against this federal overreach, and this national search delivers on that promise,” Jones said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent days, the Washington Post </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2026/01/16/george-mason-vmi-lawyers-fired-jay-jones/?utm_campaign=wp_main&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Jones removed university lawyers at George Mason and VMI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Attorney General Jason Miyares similarly removed university counsel in 2022, with the office stating at the time it is common for a new attorney general to appoint counsel who share their philosophy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones’ office said postings for higher education counsel have been advertised in several nationally recognized higher education associations to find &#8220;top legal talent to represent our institutions and protect their integrity.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s Thursday afternoon declaration of a state of emergency due to the anticipated severe winter weather triggered Virginia’s </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-post-disaster-anti-price-gouging-act/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anti-gouging statutes,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which protect consumers from paying “outrageously high prices” for essential goods during an emergency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protected items and services include water, ice, food, generators, batteries, home repair materials and services, and tree removal services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The office of Attorney General Jay Jones said shoppers who suspect they are victims of price gouging can call the Consumer Protection Hotline at (800)-552-9963, email consumer@oag.state.va.us, or </span><a href="https://jayjones.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b5682329ec900595837237839&amp;id=1e800817ec&amp;e=e1c5f1bbde" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">download</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a complaint form. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The basic test for determining if a price is unconscionable is whether the post-disaster price grossly exceeds the price charged for the same good or services during the 10 days immediately prior to the disaster,” the office stated in a release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Attorney General will investigate complaints, except those concerning gasoline or motor fuel prices. Those are handled by the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia officials are projecting snowfall to begin Saturday evening and end Monday morning, with freezing temperatures expected to continue through Thursday.</span></p>

The bill has advanced a few years in a row but fell short of becoming law due to some legislators’ concerns over cost.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 4 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Sen. Danica Roem, D-Prince William, and House Bill 96 by Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria, narrows the scope of free meals provided to students to just breakfast, and would have the state reimburse reimburse each school for the breakfasts they provide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After clearing the Senate and Education Committee </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/vote-details/SB4/20261/S4V470" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unanimously</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Thursday, it will be further deliberated in the Finance and Appropriations Committee. Bennett-Parker’s companion bill has also been advancing </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/vote-details/HB96/20261/H09V2610065" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">with bipartisan support.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If passed, the measures would bring Virginia in line with other states. Arkansas </span><a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/2025/02/21/free-school-breakfast-maternal-health-medicaid-school-cellphone-ban-all-become-arkansas-law/#:~:text=Act%20123%20will%20provide%20free%20breakfast%20to,program%20beginning%20with%20the%202025%2D2026%20academic%20year;" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">passed a similar law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster </span><a href="https://scdailygazette.com/2026/01/13/sc-governors-last-budget-continues-push-to-raise-teacher-pay-keep-tuition-steady/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">included language</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create a free breakfast program in his recent state budget. Prior to its passage in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders noted it as a </span><a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/2025/01/14/arkansas-governor-lays-out-legislative-priorities-in-state-of-the-state/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislative priority</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with The Mercury Thursday afternoon, Roem jokingly referred to Arkansas as a “blue progressive bastion,” given that Huckabee Sanders is a Republican and with the Republican-majority state championing the issue, Roem suspects bipartisan support for her bill can grow within Virginia’s legislature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also part of state Democratic lawmakers’ priorities to address affordability issues — a matter that won them gains in the legislature and the governorship of Abigail Spanberger. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roem has carried some iteration of this bill for </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/01/24/free-school-breakfasts-move-closer-to-reality-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but thinks the bill has a good chance of passing this year. It’s a stepping stone to a larger priority, she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To be clear, I am using the School Breakfast bill to eventually get to breakfast and lunch,” she said, adding  that  she plans to introduce a free school lunch version next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal to provide free lunch for students is “still super important” said Sarah Steely, director of No Kid Hungry Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steely, who has advocated for Roem’s previous bills, noted how the higher cost of providing free school meals in Roem’s previous bills had been a hurdle for many legislators. A focus on breakfast this year, she believes, will be more attainable while they work towards the free lunch bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2025 </span><a href="https://state.nokidhungry.org/virginia/2025/09/02/new-poll-virginians-going-into-debt-over-rising-food-costs/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">commissioned by Steely’s organization showed that 45% of respondents claimed their debt has increased in the past year due to rising costs of food. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past year, 65% of respondents with families reported choosing between</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“buying enough nutritious food and affording other essentials, like paying for gas or transportation, utilities, rent or mortgage payments, health care for themselves or a child, education expenses and saving for retirement,” the survey noted.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation at large has strained households across the country, but Steely emphasized that middle-income and lower-income families are feeling it harder. The Federal Reserve recently</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/business/consumer-prices-inflation-economy.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicated sticky inflation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through consumer price rises. Inflation rates that were higher during the COVID-19 pandemic and had started trending down since 2022 have begun  creeping back up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This rising cost of living, Steely said, means having free breakfast can help families with school-age children stretch their dollars a little further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steely emphasized that breakfast nourishes children and boosts their ability to focus, and the free breakfast measure can help parents make ends meet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I really do think about this through the lens of supporting our parents and caregivers,” she said. “We can make their lives easier, and that is reason enough to do this bill.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia does not have what is colloquially referred to as “solitary confinement,” Virginia law does have “</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title53.1/chapter2/section53.1-39.2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restorative housing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” This is when incarcerated people are placed in restrictive or isolated housing, typically for safety or punishment reasons due to behavior issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Step Down program is a special type of programming for people placed in solitary housing, meant as an incentive to help them transition back into general population quarters. ACLU’s </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/cases/thorpe-et-al-v-virginia-department-corrections-et-al/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thorpe v. VADOC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> case alleges that in practice, the program lacks transparency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because the committee of prison staff that reviews their conduct meets in secret and does not document the rationale for its decisions, people in the program are not given the opportunity to know why they are kept in the Step-Down Program, much less respond or adjust their behavior,” an ACLU press release explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Del. Holly Seibold, D- Fairfax, and Sen. Mike Jones, D-Chesterfield, each visited Red Onion last year, they said they saw people in restorative housing unable to participate in legally-required out-of-cell time. Seibold worried that this sort of treatment could further exacerbate someone’s behavioral issues or lead to poor mental health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Solitary confinement will damage even the most resilient of minds,” </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/01/09/rally-continues-call-for-investigation-into-red-onion-state-prison-presses-for-prison-reforms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seibold said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2025.  “I can’t even imagine myself being in there for more than a few days and being able to remain stable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the recent ruling, the  litigation that was filed in 2019 can finally proceed to trial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, incarcerated people and their families have been outspoken about concerns of racism, abuse, retaliation and misuse of restorative housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/06/report-doesnt-rule-out-racism-or-retaliation-at-red-onion-finds-other-complaints-unsubstantiated/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state watchdog report </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">found several of the claims “unsubstantiated,” but did not rule out racism or retaliation from among inmates’ experiences. The probe, however, was narrow in scope, as it focused on allegations stemming from a handful of inmates who’d burned themselves in late 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investigation, conducted by Virignia’s Corrections Ombudsman, was made possible after state lawmakers created the position in 2024 to focus on oversight of prisons. The reports of inmates burning themselves either in protest or seeking transfer to another facility prompted the ombudsman to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/17/virginias-new-corrections-ombudsman-to-prioritize-red-onion-prison-probe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prioritize the investigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shortly after taking the job. She then spent a few months hiring additional staff before the team could conduct it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Published this month, the probe was “limited to relevant circumstances as specified in the complaints,” the report stated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But due to the information ACLU has gathered in its seven-year case against VADOC, attorney Vishal Agraharkar said that the ombudsman “will have to conduct a thorough, transparent, and far more sweeping investigation than this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, with their case deemed merited, its details could emerge through the trial process before judgement is made. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New lawsuit alleges withholding of earned sentence-trimming credits for inmates</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has not had parole since the mid-1990’s, and a relatively new law called Enhanced Earned Sentence Credits is a way that people who meet certain good behavior benchmarks can trim time behind bars off their sentences. In two new lawsuits ACLU Virginia filed in federal court, the group alleges that VADOC has unlawfully withheld credits that people have earned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not the first time VADOC has been taken to court over the matter. The Virginia Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/press-releases/supreme-court-virginia-finds-vadoc-unlawfully-keeping-steven-prease-prison/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the department kept people behind bars unlawfully. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just because VDOC doesn’t like the law as it’s written doesn’t mean it can go rogue and make its own,” Agraharkar said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State statute dictates that people can begin earning the credits as soon as they start their incarceration and have a final conviction order. However, the suit points to a VADOC policy wherein people do not begin earning the credits until the department calculates their projected release date. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This process can take months, meaning a person’s incarceration can take longer, and the ACLU argues it is “wasting taxpayer dollars” when people are incarcerated when they should not be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite becoming law in 2020 under previous Gov. Ralph Northam, Enhanced Earned Sentence Credits had a delayed enactment that later was stalled for another few years by former Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The credits were not fully implemented</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/16/earned-sentence-credit-expansions-new-parole-board-operations-to-take-effect-this-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, before facing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/09/17/sentence-trimming-program-inmates-can-earn-under-fresh-scrutiny-amid-va-attorney-general-race/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fresh scrutiny</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from both </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/01/07/youngkin-wants-to-walk-back-earned-sentence-credit-expansions-in-state-budget/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and former Attorney General Jason Miyares. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOC has faced  three previous, successful challenges concerning its application of the credits.</span></p>

Abigail Spanberger addresses the media ahead of a winter storm on Jan. 22, 2026. (Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major winter storm is set to sweep across Virginia this weekend bringing accumulations of snow, sleet, and freezing rain. Gov. Abigail Spanberger, leading the state during her first major weather event in office, declared a state of emergency Thursday and said the ice and potential power outages will pose a serious threat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are expecting large amounts of snowfall, freezing rain, and sleet,” Spanberger said at the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Emergency Operations Center in Richmond</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We also expect Virginia will experience dangerously low temperatures, power outages, and unpredictable road conditions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor’s emergency declaration will allow the National Guard to be mobilized and other resources to be staged. The weather will stay below freezing for several days following the storm and nighttime temperatures will reach single digits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Transportation </span><a href="https://x.com/VaDOT/status/2014405687653065204?s=20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on X Thursday that the agency had begun pre-treating roads statewide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you encounter our slow-moving trucks on the road, be patient and keep your distance. Give them room to work safely as we all prepare for weekend winter weather,” VDOT posted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, after the storm, it could be some time before roads are able to be cleared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is possible that some localities or some subdivisions will not see a snow plow for anywhere up to 24-48 hours after the snow is concluded,” Spanberger said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initial storm models earlier in the week were projected to have major snow totals, nearly two feet in some regions, which has since shifted north. But the ice and rain behind the snow bands particularly concern officials, because weather patterns including ice are harder to predict than ones with snow, and ice is more damaging to trees and power infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the storm promises treacherous conditions, it is not unprecedented. Michael Dutter with the National Weather Service’s Wakefield office said that these types of widespread winter storms that impact much of the country usually happen roughly once a decade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dutter said recent technology advancement helped to predict this major storm was coming much sooner than they would have been able to forecast just ten years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we have with all the computing power you know, we have probabilistic information that … we can sort of give probabilities of what area might have the best potential for a piece of snowfall,” Dutter said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dutter urged the public to prepare for the ice just as much, if not more, as they do for the snow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Richmond and surrounding areas, some members of the community are feeling nervous about whether the water systems will be able to withstand the storm, after the last major winter storm in 2025 left the city and surrounding counties without water for nearly a week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The storm triggered a power switch failure at the city’s water treatment plant that prevented backup generators from kicking in, and the problem was amplified by staff miscommunications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Mayor Danny Avula said in a press conference outside City Hall Thursday new preparations have been made at the water treatment plant ahead of this weekend’s storm in addition to the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/one-year-after-richmond-water-crisis-facility-sees-improvement-holds-out-hope-for-state-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">year-long efforts to improve the facility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Department of Utilities Director Scott Morris added that the facility’s staffing and preparations are very different from what was in place a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have both power feeds available to the plant. The backup generators are available to those plants, we’re coordinated,” Morris said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger said the Richmond water crisis was part of table top training exercises she has undertaken since she was elected. Her training helped her prepare for potential threats to the commonwealth during weather events her administration will need to respond to, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians are asked to limit travel and stay off the roads this weekend. The Virginia Department of Emergency Management is offering a list of safety and prep tips on its </span><a href="https://www.vaemergency.gov/threats/winter-weather" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters were shown the shape of a few particularly contorted districts and were asked to describe what they saw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It kind of looks like the Loch Ness Monster,&#8221; a woman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A snake that looks like it was run over by a car,&#8221; one man offered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Like a dragon on its back, floating in a pool or something,&#8221; another woman ventured.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/16/virginia-senate-democrats-advance-mid-decade-redistricting-amendment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Democrats – on party-line votes in both chambers of the General Assembly – paved the way for a statewide referendum in April in which voters will be asked whether or not Virginia should make a limited return to its gerrymandering past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Democrats succeed in re-introducing partisan gerrymandering this year, Virginia voters may be even more flummoxed by an inkblot test of the state&#8217;s 11 congressional districts.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia’s redistricting amendment: What is it and what happens if voters pass it?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic legislative leaders approved a proposed constitutional amendment that could  result in a gerrymander so extreme that a new congressional map would leave Virginia&#8217;s far southwestern tip as the only safe haven for Republican candidates. General Assembly Republicans railed against the plan, but were powerless to stop it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats say their plan is a one-time and necessary response to President Donald Trump’s unprecedented mid-decade redistricting arms race. The Republican president has demanded that red states like Texas and Florida rejigger their congressional maps in order to flip a few more Democratic districts this November in midterm elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When other states manipulate their maps to gain unfair advantage … they also harm Virginia&#8217;s ability to have its fair representation in Congress,” Democratic Majority Leader Scott Surovell said during Friday’s floor debate. “We&#8217;re simply seeking to level the playing field in Congress.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democrats’ reason that a short-term return to gerrymandering in Virginia is better than to sit by and allow Trump to manipulate the midterms and escape any check on his seemingly boundless notion of presidential power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of this month, Democrats are expected to unveil a map of how far they would press their political advantage. The state’s current congressional district split of 6-D, 5-R roughly reflects the state’s two-party competition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic legislative leaders want to flip four of the five Republican seats, leaving conservative voters in Tidewater, Southside Virginia and the Shenandoah Valley with little expectation for the rest of this decade of being able to pick a congressional candidate of their choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Abigail Spanberger, a former three-term congresswoman who made a name for herself by winning in Republican-leaning districts, has said she believes Democrats can pick up two seats this November without touching the maps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a December interview with Politico, Spanberger noted that she had carried the 1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> District and the 2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Districts, which stretch from Henrico County to Virginia Beach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to flip seats in the House of Representatives, and I know that we can because we just — I just won those districts,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislative leaders say they also want to flip the 5</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> District,which extends from Charlottesville to the North Carolina line, and the 6</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> District, which runs the length of the Shenandoah Valley from Roanoke to Winchester.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/19/spanberger-urges-action-on-democracy-costs-in-first-address-to-virginia-lawmakers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first address to the General Assembly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Monday, Spanberger gave her strongest endorsement so far of the April ballot measure, calling it a justifiable response to actions by other states to undermine democratic norms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Make no mistake,” she said, her tone firmer, “Virginia will be responsive, targeted and only with the will of the people. And I trust the voters to get this one right.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What would Democrats’ 10-1 map look like?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reaction of the voters could depend on how extreme of a gerrymander Democrats put forward later this month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a debate among Democrats about how far to push their advantage. Democratic leaders including Virginia Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, have </span><a href="https://x.com/SenLouiseLucas/status/2012285930229334235?s=20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advocated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a 10-D,-1-R map.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hobbyist mapmakers have posted various options for a 10-1 configuration, including one that </span><a href="https://davesredistricting.org/maps#viewmap::598f596f-9580-481c-9567-5cc4088cee3a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deep-blue Fairfax County broken into five narrow channels of voters that fan out into the rest of the state. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_46306" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:1427px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-46306" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/10-1_Map_Full.jpg" alt="" width="1427" height="733" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/10-1_Map_Full.jpg 1427w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/10-1_Map_Full-300x154.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/10-1_Map_Full-1024x526.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/10-1_Map_Full-768x394.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1427px) 100vw, 1427px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This unofficial rendering could be what Virginia Democrats&#8217;10-d, 1-R congressional district map will look like, according to hobbyists mapmakers. Democrats have said they will release their proposed map before it goes to the public for a vote in April. (Photo courtesy DavesRedistricting.org)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this version, people as far as Rockingham County in the Shenandoah Valley, Powhatan in the western exurbs of Richmond and Mathews County on the lower Chesapeake Bay could find themselves represented by someone from Fairfax County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to know if people will be bothered by the disruption caused by so many voters being shifted to districts. Will voters care that a 10-1 map could result in nearly half of the state’s congressional residing in Fairfax County?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger has cautioned against a maximalist map, which could put at risk some of the six districts currently represented by Democrats.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas did not respond publicly to Spanberger, but on social media told the state’s Democratic congressmen to put on their big-boy pants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyone in the congressional delegation who wants a seat needs to campaign for it and not expect a safe seat,” she said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Analysts split on whether Virginia’s mid-decade changes will make a difference </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dave Daley, a national redistricting expert, said that Democrats in Virginia and elsewhere are placing too much emphasis on the short-term promise of gerrymandering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daley said the only sure path forward for a Democratic majority in the U.S. House of Representatives is for the party to learn how to replicate Spanberger’s success in reaching voters in rural districts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term math simply won’t work for Democrats after congressional seats are reapportioned based on the next Census in 2030, Daley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California and northeast states stand to lose 12-14 seats to fast-growing red states like Texas, Arizona and Florida. And if the U.S. Supreme Court invalidates the last vestiges of the Voting Rights Act later this year, another 12-19 Democratic seats in the deep South would be at risk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Democrats can&#8217;t gerrymander their way out of this,” he said, “They have to find a way to persuade voters that they are on their side. I&#8217;m not against fighting back against unfairness, I&#8217;m simply saying if you are going to charge up a hill, have a plan that works.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some analysts predict that Trump — with his foreign policy interference, ICE raids in Democratic cities and voters’ mounting worry about rising health insurance costs  — will lose so many House seats this November that one or two extra seats from Virginia would hardly be worth the effort. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veteran Democratic analyst James Carville recently forecast that </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5694291-democrats-midterm-elections-james-carville/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats will gain a minimum 25 seats, maybe as high as 45</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Frankly, it’s going to be a wipeout,” Carville said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What do Virginia’s 2020 redistricting reform advocates say now?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November 2020, voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment to rein in politicians’ ability to draw district lines. </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20201103/referendum/1601/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure passed in every Virginia locality except Arlington County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OneVirginia 2021, the bipartisan group that was the moral voice behind the state’s 2020 redistricting effort, mobilized roughly 500 volunteers who used to show up at the polls statewide with signs reading “Fair elections start with fair districts” or “It’s not about right vs. left. It’s about right vs. wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the success or failure of Virginia’s mid-decade redistricting effort has yet to be determined, one thing seems certain: OneVirginia 2021 — now rebranded as UpVote Virginia — will not be calling out oddly-shaped districts or questioning the whip-lash reversion to politicians picking their voters instead of voters picking the politicians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UpVote Virginia has shifted its focus to improving the democratic process through ranked-choice voting. The group’s executive director Liz White said that UpVote will stick to its new mission and has no plans to get involved in this year’s redistricting fight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel like everyone is disappointed to be having this conversation again, and felt that Virginia will not be part of this ugly national fight,” White said. “It’s disheartening.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, last fall in California,  when Democrats sought to counter a mid-decade redistricting in Texas, reform groups did not oppose a ballot initiative that bypassed the bipartisan </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Citizens_Redistricting_Commission" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Citizens Redistricting Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People who previously had worked on redistricting reform were basically told to stay on the sidelines,” said Carah Ong Whaley, who, as the executive director of a California democracy reform group, was one of the few reform advocates who spoke out. “Many of the in-state groups were frustrated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ong Whaley, who also is a program manager at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, took the position that &#8220;fighting fire with fire leads to a scorched earth democracy.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why we&#8217;d want to go back, when what is best for our country, period, is free and fair elections that are competitive,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Trump launched the mid-decade redistricting battle, other reform advocates in Virginia thought the state would be immune because the process of amending the state constitution usually takes several years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were patting ourselves on the back and thinking, ‘Oh, this can’t happen in Virginia,’” said Kathy Utgoff, a retired economist who served as a commissioner of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 2002 to 2006. Utgoff also volunteered with OneVirginia 2021 in the Falls Church area and found meaning in grassroots work to bring fair elections to Virginia. She now chairs the UpVote Virginia board of directors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Democrats devised a way to speed up the process by putting the question to voters in a special statewide election in April, Utgoff was frustrated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ending (gerrymandering) took the better part of a decade. Now the plan is to undo the commission in the matter of months,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, other reform advocates support a limited, one-time carve out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob Gibson, who served on the advisory board for OneVirginia 2021 and once led the bipartisan-nurturing Sorensen Institute, called the upcoming amendment a “necessary response if we are going to preserve democracy” in this country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think this is an unfortunate thing that has to be done,” added Gibson, who lives in Charlottesville.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats emphasize that their proposal is a temporary exception that would leave Virginia’s bipartisan Redistricting Commission in charge when lines are scheduled to be redrawn in 2031. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They emphasize that voters will get a chance to see the proposed map and must give their permission to any changes in the state’s congressional maps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The main thing is it’ll go to a referendum,” Lucas said. “But I think (voters) are going to love the maps and they’re going to love the 10-1.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pro-redistricting campaign takes shape</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With reform advocates on the sidelines, a Democrat-funded organization called </span><a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ads_ms_vafe_20260114_dd_gs_natl_launch?source=ads_ms_VAFE_20260114-VAFE-DD-GS-Natl-launch_HighIntent_a001-Launch-rst_p%3Avirginians%20for%20fair%20elections&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23456549259&amp;gbraid=0AAAABCh0qkLuTeeVomb4MKJQe_4gDfamV&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA7LzLBhAgEiwAjMWzCNc0hQFHM4JfJgx4aYNvEXJy1MZ71i-NenDEU-SKZZ8-0Yxl5pqwuRoCOkQQAvD_BwE" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians for Fair Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has appropriated the reform group’s rhetoric and moral certainty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can restore fairness with an amendment that gives Virginians the power to level the playing field,” </span><a href="https://www.virginiansforfairelections.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">says a video released by Virginians for Fair Elections. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And it&#8217;s temporary, reaffirming Virginia&#8217;s commitment to bipartisan redistricting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians for Fair Elections had yet to  file paperwork with the state Department of Elections, but has already lined up social media influencers to talk up the April ballot measure, including TikTok star Suzanne Lambert, also known as the &#8220;</span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=Regina+George+liberal&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjclZ_Mq5qSAxU1EFkFHQkOKzEQgK4QegQIARAC" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regina George liberal.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221;  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lambert </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTrLI5lEZRY/?igsh=bHNxMTF1cGgwMjI2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">encouraged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> her Instagram audience to vote yes to Virginia’s redistricting amendment in April and reminded them that it would be a temporary measure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Democracy is not doing so hot right now,” Lambert said in a rat-a-tat cadence. “No one wants to see this long term. Think of this as like a ‘situationship’ and not the one you bring home to mom.”</span></p>

Adele McClure join parents and advocates for early childhood and access for a gathering in Richmond on Jan. 21, 2026. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaila Brewer, a Chesapeake mother and special education teacher, had to leave her job during the COVID-19 pandemic to care for her five-year-old son, who is autistic. Child care services were scarce at the time, and the few available could not accommodate her child’s special needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was extremely disheartening … I felt like my child was unwanted or pushed aside,” Brewer said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That experience spurred her to advocate alongside other parents and supporters at the state Capitol on Wednesday and urge lawmakers to expand early childhood care options.The group addressed the urgent demand for high-quality child care and pressed for the state to increase child care investments to benefit more families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/09/in-statewide-survey-employers-say-virginia-child-care-crisis-negatively-impacts-businesses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that 65% of Virginia employers said their workers struggle to find open child care slots and more than 85% cited cost as a major burden for their employees.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BSVyQhyqdl"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/09/in-statewide-survey-employers-say-virginia-child-care-crisis-negatively-impacts-businesses/">In statewide survey, employers say Virginia child care crisis negatively impacts businesses</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;In statewide survey, employers say Virginia child care crisis negatively impacts businesses&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/09/in-statewide-survey-employers-say-virginia-child-care-crisis-negatively-impacts-businesses/embed/#?secret=dZv66L5DtB#?secret=BSVyQhyqdl" data-secret="BSVyQhyqdl" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the pandemic, the federal government distributed relief funds to states, including Virginia, to stabilize child care providers, expand subsidy programs and increase access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But after the funds expired in 2023, a gap was left for the commonwealth to fill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers and then-Gov. Glenn Youngkin responded by investing nearly $1 billion in child care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said lawmakers invested around $900 million in child care over the past two budget cycles during a meeting with parents Wednesday morning. He also proposed successful legislation that made the commonwealth the first to create a child care reimbursement program for his colleagues in the House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand how important early child care is,” Scott said. “If I’m not known for anything else when I leave this job as speaker, it would be that we have done everything that we can to make child care more affordable and more accessible in the commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, advocates are asking lawmakers to go further to make child care more accessible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Promise Partnership, a coalition of organizations advocating for fully funding high-quality child care, is requesting a state investment of $681 million in the 2027-2028 biennial budget. The partnership said this will help meet families&#8217; needs, compensate educators, keep classrooms open and incentivize employers to support employees’ child care needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tomashia Cornitcher, a parent and Family Connections for Kids First Years coordinator, said her family benefited from early childhood education. She’s now working with other parents to have the same opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are grateful for our representatives,” Cornitcher said. “However, we are still in dire need because that investment helped us prevent families from losing services, but did not extend access to more families who are on the wait list.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VPM News </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2025-10-24/child-care-waitlists-economic-toll-families-uva-study-bassok-conway" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last October that nearly 14,000 children were on a wait list for the Child Care Subsidy Program alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan O’Tooole, co-executive of Freedom Virginia, a coalition member, said another key priority is paying quality teachers fairly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If a child is in a child care program, those teachers are teaching,” O’Toole said. “It is not babysitting or caring until the parent comes home, but it&#8217;s early education that is crucial to a child&#8217;s development and having a successful system that can promote economic mobility, that can promote economic stability, that helps businesses keep their employees. All of that only works if we have those providers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the child care challenges low-income families face, Cornitcher also said middle-class families are feeling the financial pinch. She said in some cases, families earn too much to qualify for free or low-cost early childhood education, and too little to afford private options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates are backing legislative proposals aligned with Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s </span><a href="https://abigailspanberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Spanberger-Education-Policy_L3.pdf?utm_source=Spanberger+for+Governor+Press+List&amp;utm_campaign=ce1d1fb29a-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_08_08_05_20&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-ce1d1fb29a-506626301" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which underscores expanding access and strengthening the early child care workforce as the pathway for a stronger, more inclusive system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB3" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lashrecse Aird</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Petersburg, and Del. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB18" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adele McClure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Arlington, are carrying a proposal to create the Employee Child Care Assistance Program, which would allow employers to receive state matching funds to help pay for an employee’s child care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mamie Locke</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Hampton, and Del. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1208" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briana Sewell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Prince William, filed bills to expand Virginia’s Child Care Subsidy Program so more families qualify based on income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal directs the Virginia Department of Education to create a phased reduction for the Child Care Subsidy Program, so aid decreases gradually as families earn more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB254" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackie Glass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Norfolk, along with </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Locke</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is also carrying </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB254" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would make child care subsidies decline more gradually as families earn more, rather than drop off abruptly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Mike Cherry, R-Colonial Heights, told the Mercury he supports Glass’ legislation and wants to build on the commonwealth’s progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are ahead, and we will stay ahead,” Cherry said. “We want to continue to innovate … and continue looking at what we&#8217;re doing — how do we encourage people to upskill, how do we encourage people to make more money, to be more self-sufficient, to not need the subsidies? … It&#8217;s by providing them that safety net as they climb that corporate ladder, to be the resources for them, to encourage them to be better and to do more.”</span></p>

Abigail Spanberger gives her first address to the joint General Assembly. (Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her first address to the joint General Assembly, Gov. Abigail Spanberger stated that Virginia will rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RGGI is a regional initiative by 10 states to cap carbon emissions by limiting how much pollution energy production facilities can emit – and they have to purchase permits for each ton of carbon they emit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Permit sales are held quarterly. The money earned by each state’s sale is then reinvested back into the state for flooding resilience projects, weatherization and energy efficiency programs for low-income households.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia </span><a href="https://vcnva.org/issue/rggi-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">received over $800 million over the three years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the state was in the program before the removal. The law directs 50% of the funds to low-income efficiency programs, 45% to the Community Flood Preparedness Fund, and the remainder to administrative costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“RGGI generated hundreds of millions of dollars for Virginia — dollars that went directly to flood mitigation, energy efficiency programs, and lowering bills for families who need help most,” Spanberger said in her speech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The estimated cost of the utilities’ permits that is passed down to ratepayers averages about $2 a month for most residential customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When in office, Gov. Glenn Youngkin removed the state from the agreement, calling it an unnecessary tax. The move was then appealed in court and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/20/judge-deems-youngkins-actions-to-withdraw-virginia-from-rggi-unlawful/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a federal judge deemed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the governor&#8217;s removal of the state unlawful because the General Assembly hadn’t authorized it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the process to rejoin is not as easy as just saying the state wants in. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB397" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 397</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Del. Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, is working through the General Assembly that will solidify the ability of the body to put the state into RGGI and set up the market cap trade process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herring said there are efforts to add an amendment to the budget bill that would speed up the process and potentially get the state back into RGGI this spring. Some advocates are hoping the state can partake in the sale slated for early summer if the amendment is approved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those opposed to the state rejoining the agreement point towards the cost to consumers – which some believe goes against the affordability messaging that Democrats campaigned on, since it would tack on an additional charge on utility bills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A representative for the Virginia Manufacturers Association, Brett Vassey, spoke against the bill in a subcommittee with concerns over the cost and urged the lawmakers to consider changing where the funds are funneled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need more (energy) capacity in the market,” Vassey said. “There probably is an opportunity to look at that allocation and see if there&#8217;s a way to generate more electricity, even green electricity, and help local governments to be part of that as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some lawmakers are not on board with the effort to return the state to RGGI. Del. Joseph McNamara, R-Roanoke County, said Virginia is purchasing power to meet demand from states that are not part of the agreement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I talk about us going out of state from a power procurement perspective, it’s impacting our transmission costs,” McNamara said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents for the bill said the cost is worth it for flood resilience and the aid to low-income families that will see their bills go down after benefitting from the efficiency programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What they ignore is the long-term benefits, and how it&#8217;s actually going to decrease costs for energy in the long term for low income consumers,” Herring said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed budget amendment language is anticipated to be released later this week. There has been no word yet on if or when Attorney General Jay Jones will withdraw the state from the appeal to the previous judge’s order against the removal from RGGI.</span></p>

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Days after Gov. Abigail Spanberger </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/12/18/spanberger-makes-affordability-centerpiece-of-2026-agenda-as-legislative-session-nears/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renewed her push</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to tackle housing affordability in her State of the Commonwealth address, Virginia lawmakers say they are newly optimistic about advancing a slate of bills aimed at easing the state’s housing crunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, referred to the proposals as “one of the key things that won us a historic majority in the House of Delegates.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Spanberger, Democratic lawmakers ran last year on promises to</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/09/30/at-forum-central-virginia-house-of-delegates-candidates-discuss-housing-affordability-policy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> address housing challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — from the rising cost of rent to barriers to home ownership and a lack of supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several of the proposals had previously cleared the legislature before being vetoed by former Gov. Glenn Youngkin. At a news conference Wednesday, both new and returning lawmakers expressed renewed confidence that those ideas could finally become law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the measures highlighted was </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB816" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 816</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, carried by Helmer, which would allow by-right zoning for apartment buildings or townhomes in certain commercial corridors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More simply put, “that bill streamlines the conversion of old strip malls and office parks into new homes,” Helmer said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, emphasized that the bill could help keep people closer to where they work — particularly public servants such as teachers, firefighters, law enforcement officers and service industry workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the patron of the Senate version, VanValkenburg shared his own experience as a public school teacher, noting that if he were just starting out today, he would struggle to afford housing in the region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a teacher who can afford a house in my locality because I bought a house 20 years ago and have that capital,” he said. “Teachers that are starting in the profession now cannot afford to buy a house in Western Henrico anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helmer and VanValkenburg have also carried a more contentious proposal </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/01/21/housing-proposals-spark-clash-over-state-and-local-roles-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highlighting longstanding tensions </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">between state and local governments. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB804" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would require localities to take steps to boost housing affordability or risk state intervention overriding certain local decisions. Under the measure, local governments must “demonstrate a good faith effort” to meet housing growth targets outlined in the legislation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill did not reach Youngkin’s desk, though it did pass the House of Delegates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is give and take in the bill,” VanValkenburg said last year while defending it. “I would argue that this is more than a local problem, this is a state problem.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sentiment was echoed repeatedly during Wednesday’s news as lawmakers discussed additional proposals returning this session. Several pointed to a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/08/21/virginians-say-housing-costs-are-a-crisis-want-lawmakers-to-act/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">conducted last year that identified housing affordability as a top concern for Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Joshua Cole, D-Fredericksburg — who is also a pastor — is carrying </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1279" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would allow faith-based institutions or nonprofit organizations to build housing on land they already own. A version of the bill was introduced last year, and U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., has also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/federal-yes-in-gods-backyard-bill-could-help-va-faith-based-groups-build-affordable-housing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">introduced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> similar legislation in Congress. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB262" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 262</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Del. Shelly Simmonds, D-Newport News, would prohibit localities from requiring minimum parking mandates for new developments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simmonds said the bill “gives flexibility to builders to provide the right amount of parking.” She emphasized that it does not eliminate parking altogether, but removes locally mandated minimums that may not make sense for certain projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Saddam Salim, D-Fairfax, who is carrying the Senate version, said parking mandates can result in wasted space that could otherwise be used for housing or drive up rent prices. He noted that depending on a development’s location and residents, not everyone can afford a car or may choose to rely on public transit instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Helmer said he is “encouraged” by the new governor and the a renewed momentum around housing policy. While tensions can arise between state and local governments, he noted how some legislators bring first-hand experience from local office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That includes Del. Margaret Franklin, D-Prince William, who previously served her county’s board of supervisors. Newly-elected to the House, Franklin has been appointed to the Housing, Cities and Towns Committee, where she can draw on that experience as lawmakers debate housing legislation. </span></p>

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the 2026 General Assembly session in full swing, Democrats on Tuesday advanced a slate of voting and campaign finance measures aimed at expanding access to the ballot box and increasing transparency in elections, while narrowly rejecting a series of Republican-backed proposals that would have scaled back early voting and limited when voters could cast ballots in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before dawn, a House Elections Subcommittee on campaign finance unanimously advanced </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB44" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 44</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, which would require the State Board of Elections to create a comprehensive, user-friendly online campaign finance portal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal would mirror many of the functions currently offered by the </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/about-us/mission/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Public Access Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit organization that aggregates campaign finance data, election results and political information to make it accessible to the public, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/11/03/a-virginia-political-scribe-recalls-the-dark-ages-of-covering-campaigns-and-elections-before-vpap/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">journalists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and researchers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krizek told the panel the bill is designed to modernize how campaign finance information is disclosed and accessed, making it easier for the public to analyze political spending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a really good open government bill,” Krizek said. “It would be a friendly portal where you have the interface where you can manipulate the data, create your own reports, and put it in Excel, and things like that. So it’s just really modernizing campaign finance reform disclosures.”</span></p>

Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax (left), confers with Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt. (Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krizek carried a similar measure last year that passed the House but stalled in the Appropriations Committee, raising questions again Tuesday about whether funding had been secured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This bill goes back to my very first year in the House of Delegates,” said Del. Phillip Scott, R-Spotsylvania. “Is this in the budget now, or is this something that we’re just going to have to wait and see?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krizek responded that the funding question had been addressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The governor’s budget has money for this, I believe $2 million,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. J.J. Singh, D-Loudoun, also questioned how the state-run portal would differ from existing tools, including the state’s Legislative Information System and private platforms like VPAP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I personally think we could use a better interface,” Singh said, describing the state’s current </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislative Information System</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as “a little clunky,” but asked whether the bill would simply duplicate what already exists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krizek said the measure was not meant to replace VPAP but to ensure that access to campaign finance data is not dependent on private fundraising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not about being better, really. I think VPAP does a pretty good job,” Krizek said. “It’s really about not relying on private charity to be the one that’s filling in this gap.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that VPAP’s work helped establish the standard the state now seeks to adopt and said the bill was a direct result of that success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The subcommittee reported the bill unanimously to the full committee.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate panel advances ERIC, absentee ballot bill</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later Tuesday, the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee advanced several Democratic-backed election measures while rejecting multiple Republican efforts to limit early voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On an 8-7 vote, the committee passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB57" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 57</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, which would require Virginia to maintain membership in the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a multistate data-sharing consortium used to help states maintain accurate voter rolls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the panel rejected another VanValkenburg proposal, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB76" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 76</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on a 9-6 vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would have consolidated presidential-year primaries by moving all primaries for offices </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">appearing on the November ballot to the presidential primary date, while also adjusting petition signature rules and campaign finance deadlines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VanValkenburg said the current system of holding two primaries in presidential years confuses voters and suppresses turnout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is just because in presidential primary years, we have two primaries, which leads to a lot of confusion among voters,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee advanced </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB58" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 58</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, on a 9-5 vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would extend the deadline for receipt of absentee ballots, ballot cure materials and certain provisional ballot documentation from noon to 5 p.m. on the third day after an election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Favola said the change reflects current mail delivery realities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The only thing this bill does is it extends the time that a ballot can be received from 12 noon on the third day after the election to 5 p.m.,” she said, noting that postal delivery now takes nearly three days longer on average. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Republican early voting limits fall on party-line vote</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On mostly party-line votes, the committee rejected several Republican proposals aimed at scaling back early voting.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB46" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 46</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Sen. Christie New Craig, R-Chesapeake, would have reduced in-person absentee voting from 45 days before an election to 15 days. Craig said registrars are struggling with the volume and cost of elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re having so many more elections, and so my bill just takes it to 15 days,” she said, arguing that long early voting windows make it harder for candidates to meet voters and for registrars to manage workloads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee killed the bill 8-7.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A similar proposal, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB298" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 298</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, would have limited early in-person voting to the 10 days immediately preceding an election, with expanded daily hours. Peake said local governments are being stretched thin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We might end up with 170 or 180 days of voting,” he said. “It’s really too much of a burden.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peake emphasized that his bill would not affect mail-in voting and described it as a cost-saving measure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee rejected the bill, also by an 8-7 vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The panel likewise voted down </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB533" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 533</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Sen. David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke County, which would have standardized early voting hours statewide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suetterlein argued that uneven local discretion could influence election outcomes, particularly in primaries.</span></p>

Her union is advocating for a collective bargaining bill that would allow government workers and state-funded employees to negotiate things like wages or working conditions. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEIU Virginia  512 is part of the Service Employees International Union, which advocates for a range of service workers around the world. At Virginia’s state Capitol on Tuesday, the group urged lawmakers to pass a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1263" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would allow home health workers to collectively bargain for better wages, benefits or working conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the bill broadly applies to public employees like government workers, it would also create the Virginia Home Care Authority within the state’s Department of Medical Assistance Services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEIU leaders said the legislation would empower Joy Barnes, a home health worker who can’t afford to take a sick day when she falls ill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a medical emergency due to her anemia, Barnes relayed how she struggled “to play catch up” on bills afterwards. Her job also puts her health at risk, and she has caught both minor colds and infections that have required hospitalization while caring for some of her clients. Each time she has had to take a break, she loses pay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workers like Barnes are the “backbone” of the health care industry and support all other types of workers, SEIU Virginia 512 member Athena Jones added during the group’s press conference on Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones and others said the bill is necessary because public employees are barred from collective bargaining at the state level. Some local cities or counties have permitted it, but with home health care workers typically compensated through Medicaid, they’ve not had a seat at the table to negotiate along with other types of public employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need the opportunity to be able to say what we need as home care workers — being able to thrive, not just survive,” Jones said, who described being treated as “invisible” among other types of health workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re a part of the system that allows other people to be able to go to work, allows industries to thrive, allows opportunities where there may not be because the support isn&#8217;t there,” she said. </span></p>
<p>Clients of home health workers, like Olson of Arc of Virginia, also support the bill.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she lives with a genetic condition called Williams Syndrome, Olson works with Arc of Virginia as a coordinator. Assistance from a home health worker has allowed her to keep doing the work that she loves, she said, which is why she supports the current bill and has spent nearly two decades advocating for other measures and providing insights to lawmakers who craft them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me and my friends need services so we can live a life like yours,” she told the crowd at Tuesday’s press conference. “I want to be honest, I could not do the things I do without support.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/the-fight-for-fairness-democrats-push-for-collective-bargaining-rights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collective bargaining bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is being carried by Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, in the House and Sen. Scott Surrovell, D-Fairfax, in the Senate. It will likely advance through the legislature again this year and may be less likely to face a governor’s veto, as it did under Republican Glenn Youngkin. New governor Abigail Spanberger had campaigned on addressing affordability issues and could view this bill through that lens </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surovell said that he’s “optimistic” about the bill’s success, but noted that more nuance and details might need to be sorted out in the months ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a complex subject,” he said, noting challenges in determining how it would apply to governmental entities around the state along with public universities. ”A lot of people assumed Youngkin would veto it before, so they didn&#8217;t spend a lot of time on it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Surovell anticipates robust discussion in committees before the bill can advance to both chambers where it could be workshopped further or advanced with no tweaks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2026 legislative session is scheduled to run through mid-March.</span></p>

(Photo by Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As utility bills surge for ratepayers in Virginia, lawmakers from Southwest Virginia are pushing legislation that will urge the State Corporation Commission to review how to calculate profit levels and storm recovery costs for Appalachian Power Company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The utilities have found time and time again ways to game the system in order to maximize the amount of profitt they are getting called a return on equity,” said Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke. “In reality, the more expensive stuff that they have, the more profit they can make.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian Power Company serves the southwestern portion of the state and some parts of Central Virginia. It is the second largest utility in the commonwealth, and like Dominion Energy, the cost of transmission, base rates, and fuel rates, among other costs, have led to customer bills significantly increasing in recent years. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.blob.core.windows.net/files/1087323.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1075</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Senate Bill 961 have multiple goals that would give more power to the SCC to review how the utility calculates its profit margin, otherwise known as return on equity, and decide how much of the utility’s infrastructure expansion or repair costs are passed on to residential customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bills aim to require the SCC to review Appalachian Power’s transmission planning. Transmission lines are what bring the power to the customers, but the cost of those lines is </span><a href="https://www.ferc.gov/explainer-transmission-planning-and-cost-allocation-final-rule" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The legislation wants the SCC to evaluate how much transmission APCo needs to build so that excessive costs aren’t passed down to the rate payers by the utility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe that when you have an accounting system that is built on you get higher profit with having more expensive actual assets, then you&#8217;re not going to be incentivized to have cheaper assets,” Rasoul said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill also looks to review how storm recovery costs are recouped from ratepayers. When power infrastructure is damaged in a storm, companies will petition the SCC to ask to recover funding from customers to rebuild. The legislation wants to find ways to reduce cost in those repairs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the bills pass, the Attorney General will be tasked with studying alternative ways for the utilities to calculate their profit levels. The SCC already has authority to review the profit margins laid out by Appalachian Power in the biannual rate cases and determine within a range what is fair and reasonable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The spirit of the regulated rate of return was meant to mirror what&#8217;s happening on the capital markets,”Rasoul said. “Now, if you look at a capital market rate of return, a higher one might be 6% today; they&#8217;re getting 9.75% so they&#8217;re far above where that spirit is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The utility is currently capped at 9.75% profit margins after the last rate case, which is less than the range the company offered to the SCC in the initial petition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Appalachian Power is the only major utility in Virginia whose rates have gone down thanks to smart policy supported by APCo and crafted in conjunction with lawmakers,” a spokesperson for Appalachian Power  said in a statement. “The State Corporation Commission closely scrutinizes all of the company’s costs and rates to ensure they are reasonable and prudent.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power companies are also able to purchase power from outside sources when they are unable to generate enough for their customers. That can be done through PJM, the regional grid operator, or other subsidiaries. The legislation directs the SCC to make sure that Appalachian Power  is buying the most affordable options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What an energy conglomerate can do is make deals essentially with itself to ensure that it is buying energy from its own subsidiaries, but that may not necessarily be in our best interest,” Rasoul said. “And we have seen that attorneys general, both Republican and Democrat, say that this is a concern.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian Power is mandated under the Virginia Clean Economy Act to move to fully renewable energy sources by 2045. Despite the bipartisan group of legislators supporting the regulations legislation, they differ on if they support the VCEA. They all agree that the General Assembly needs to step in to try and find ways to ensure that utility rates are fair and equitable.</span></p>

Here, lawmakers will decide the fate of a measure to restore Hampton University's land-grant status. (Photo by Markus Schmidt/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal government denied Hampton University special funds for over 100 years because it believed that only one Black institution in Virginia could receive land-grant funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, state lawmakers want to overturn that 1920 decision and restore Hampton’s land-grant status. This is part of a broader effort to reform segregation-era policies with present-day values of equity and opportunity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hampton University President Darrell Williams said at Monday’s Senate Higher Education Subcommittee meeting that it&#8217;s common for a state to have more than one land-grant institution. Alabama, for example, has Alabama A&amp;M, Auburn, and Tuskegee universities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hampton received designated federal funding for 48 years, from 1872 to 1920, which ceased afterwards. Now its leaders and some lawmakers are trying to fix that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If successful, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB274" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 274</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would restore Hampton as a land-grant university. The bill, carried by Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, would also establish a special fund to support this restoration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have been promoting this cause for the last two to three years, because we think it&#8217;s fair and just,” Williams said on Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation defines the types of funding and programs Hampton may join under this status and assigns the university community service, education, and research responsibilities to benefit the public and the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importantly, Hampton would also rejoin a short list of land-grant institutions in the commonwealth. The Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862 created Virginia Tech to develop colleges in agriculture, engineering, and mechanics, with proceeds from federal land sales funding these efforts. The U.S. seized much of that land from Native American communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because most Virginia colleges barred Black students at the time, leaders created the Second Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1890, which enabled the founding of historically Black institutions such as Virginia State University. Virginia Tech admitted its first Black students in 1953.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Locke said the proposal would not affect or reduce funding for Virginia Tech and Virginia State University, a concern raised among the subcommittee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Senate Bill 274 is not designed to revisit the past with grievance, but to complete the historical record and align Virginia&#8217;s policies with present-day values and needs,&#8221; Locke said on Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that the proposal “does not take away from VSU or Virginia Tech, but merely expands opportunities for Hampton reintegrating HU into the national land grant system to bolster its research and educational initiatives.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation’s chances of success are strong. It has unanimous support from the Senate’s higher education subcommittee, which Locke chairs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Abigail Spanberger, before being elected, also </span><a href="https://democrats-agriculture.house.gov/uploadedfiles/230515_-_letter-_1890s_state_matching.pdf?utm_campaign=1916-520" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signaled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> support for Virginia’s HBCUs after federal officials in the U.S. Departments of Education and Agriculture found multiple cases of underfunding at HBCU land-grant institutions in </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/09/18/hbcu-land-grant-funding-disparities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">16 states,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> including Virginia State University, in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure must clear the Democrat-controlled General Assembly before it reaches the governor for consideration.</span></p>

(Photo courtesy of campaign)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Garrett McGuire on Tuesday defeated Republican Christopher Cardiff in a special election to represent Virginia House of Delegates District 17, filling the vacancy left by longtime Democratic lawmaker Mark Sickles, who has joined Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s administration as secretary of finance.</span></p>
<p>By 8 p.m., McGuire led Cardiff with 80.4-19.5% out of 4,360 votes cast, according to unofficial results from the Virginia Department of Elections.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The victory allows Democrats to retain the Fairfax County–based seat, which has been reliably blue in recent election cycles and includes parts of Franconia, Rose Hill and surrounding communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire will serve the remainder of Sickles’ term, which runs through 2027. He is expected to be sworn in in the coming days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sickles, a Democrat first elected to the House in 2003, stepped down late last year after Spanberger </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/12/23/appointments-of-two-key-cabinet-roles-will-trigger-another-special-election-in-house-district-17/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tapped him to lead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the state’s finance portfolio, a move that triggered the special election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His departure was </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/special-election-for-hashmis-richmond-area-senate-seat-set-for-jan-6/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one of several</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that have reshaped the House since Democrats regained control of the chamber, as multiple lawmakers have left to join the new administration or pursue higher office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement Tuesday night, House Democrats praised McGuire’s win. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span>We’re excited to welcome Garrett to the House Democratic Caucus and to work alongside him to deliver a Virginia that lowers costs for families, keeps our communities safe, and stands firm against (President Donald) Trump’s attacks on Virginians’ rights and freedoms,” the caucus said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, a longtime Fairfax County public policy professional and community leader, has chaired the board of United Community — the largest nonprofit serving the Route 1 corridor — and previously led the Fairfax-Falls Church Community Services Board, where he helped steer mental health and disability services through the COVID-19 pandemic and a major staffing shortage, his </span><a href="https://mcguirefordelegate.com/#bio" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign biography</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/house-of-delegates-17/district/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">District 17</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has favored Democrats by comfortable margins in recent statewide races. According to the Virginia Public Access Project, the district supported Democratic nominees for governor, attorney general and lieutenant governor in the most recent general election, and Democrats hold a significant edge in voter registration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday’s contest marks the latest in a series of special elections prompted by turnover in the Democratic caucus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, Democrats held onto </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/13/democrats-retain-house-districts-11-and-23-in-tuesdays-special-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Districts 11 and 23</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Northern Virginia, and retained </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/06/democrats-retain-two-richmond-area-seats-in-back-to-back-special-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two Richmond-area seats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after incumbents exited the chamber. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those wins have helped Democrats maintain their comfortable majority as the 2026 General Assembly session gets underway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With McGuire’s victory, attention now turns to the final special election on the calendar, a Feb. 10 contest in </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/state-senate-39/district/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate District 39</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Northern Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker of Alexandria will face Republican Julie Lineberry to fill the vacancy left by Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, </span><a href="https://alexandrialivingmagazine.com/news/sen-adam-ebbin-resigns-to-join-spanberger-administration/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">who joined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Spanberger’s administration as a senior adviser at the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Bennett-Parker prevails, Democrats would continue to hold their narrow control of the Senate as Spanberger begins her first legislative session with a friendly General Assembly and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/19/spanberger-urges-action-on-democracy-costs-in-first-address-to-virginia-lawmakers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an agenda focused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on affordability, health care and reproductive rights.</span></p>

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing just outside the iron fencing surrounding Virginia’s Capitol in downtown Richmond on Monday, Alexandria resident Gerald Vandendries hoisted a semi-automatic rifle and scanned the crowd gathering for Lobby Day — an annual ritual for gun rights supporters that carried renewed urgency this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re hoping to just kind of give Democrats a friendly reminder that this is our right,” Vandendries said. “Our Constitution very specifically says our rights shall not be infringed. They do not have the right in any way, shape or form to dictate to us, the civilian population, what we can or cannot own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday’s pro-Second Amendment rally, organized by the Virginia Citizens Defense League, drew nearly 1,000 people to the Bell Tower in Capitol Square. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attendance was noticeably higher than in recent years, reflecting concerns among gun owners as Democrats once again control both chambers of the General Assembly and the governor’s office — a political alignment many supporters said felt familiar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early 2020, when Democrats  gained unified control of state government for the first time in more than two decades, lawmakers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/01/30/va-democrats-have-passed-most-of-their-gun-control-bills-a-big-one-is-still-missing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enacted sweeping changes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Virginia’s gun laws, including universal background checks, a one-handgun-a-month purchasing limit and a red-flag law allowing courts to temporarily remove firearms from people deemed a danger. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation, signed into law by then-Gov. Ralph Northam, triggered </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/01/13/as-virginia-democrats-advance-new-gun-restrictions-militias-organize-promising-to-resist/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fierce opposition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and drew tens of thousands of gun rights supporters to Capitol Square for Lobby Day that January, though the demonstration remained peaceful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That history framed much of the message Monday, as speakers and attendees warned that a similar legislative push is again taking shape — and urged supporters to respond not only through rallies but by engaging in elections, local government and the courts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several speakers emphasized that even if new restrictions are enacted, gun rights advocates still have avenues to fight back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longtime VCDL coordinator Brendan Mooney, who now lives in Idaho, returned to Richmond to address the crowd. He urged attendees to run for or seek appointment to local offices, including school boards and planning commissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a lot of offices in your county that are probably filled with people that got there because they showed up,” Mooney said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. John McGuire, R-Goochland, also took the stage, urging supporters to mobilize ahead of this year’s congressional elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need all hands on deck. We&#8217;ve got the midterms coming up,” McGuire said. “I need 10 people to get 10 people to get 10 people to vote. We need your prayers. We need your dollars. We need you out there knocking on the doors now.”</span></p>

John McGuire, R-Goochland, speaks at the Virginia Citizens Defense League rally on Jan. 19, 2026. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia Mercury)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later Monday afternoon, a counter-protest gathered at the Bell Tower for an annual gun violence prevention rally that doubles as a day of remembrance for Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friends and family members of gun violence victims joined advocates from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, forming a crowd of a few hundred. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 100 attendees wore blue Superman-themed beanie hats honoring Adam Turck, a Richmond-based actor </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/crime-courts/article_659330e4-97a9-4171-94ab-743baf6434d7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">who was shot and killed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last summer after intervening in a domestic dispute while walking his dog.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While we understand and even admire what Adam did, we’re also angry it wasn’t Adam’s job to protect the vulnerable from an act of violence,” said CJ Bergen, a friend of Turck’s who spoke at the rally. “That was the commonwealth’s job.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contrast between the two events was stark. While the VCDL rally centered on frustration and resistance to anticipated legislation, the gun safety gathering emphasized remembrance, gratitude and persistence.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/state-stats/deaths/firearms.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1,237 Virginians died from gun violence in 2023. Nationwide, the </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/firearm-violence/data-research/facts-stats/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agency reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> roughly 48,000 firearm-related deaths in the same period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, who chairs a House Public Safety subcommittee, said at the later rally that addressing gun violence is personal for him after losing a family member. </span></p>

Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, speaks at a gun safety rally on Jan. 19, 2026. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, also attended the afternoon rally and expressed hope that legislation previously vetoed under Youngkin — including a safe storage proposal — could now advance under Gov. Abigail Spanberger.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia lawmakers set to debate these gun bills this session</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have already filed a broad package of firearm-related legislation this session, signaling that gun policy will again dominate debate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One proposal would impose an </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB919" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">11% excise tax</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on retail firearm and ammunition sales, directing the revenue to a state gun violence intervention and prevention fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other measures would establish standards of responsible conduct for gun manufacturers and dealers, allowing enforcement actions by the attorney general, local prosecutors or individuals harmed by violations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several bills focus on domestic violence, tightening firearm relinquishment requirements for people convicted of assault or subject to protective orders by adding age, residency and reporting standards designed to ensure guns are surrendered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers are also revisiting so-called </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB40" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ghost gun legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, strengthening penalties for manufacturing, selling or possessing undetectable plastic firearms, unserialized guns and unfinished frames or receivers, with updated language reflecting modern security screening technology and delayed effective dates beginning in 2027.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another proposal would narrow exemptions allowing firearms </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB626" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Capitol Square</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other government buildings, particularly on public college campuses, limiting them to approved academic or institutional activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have also revived an </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB62" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">assault weapons ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, introduced by Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, a measure supporters argue would reduce mass shootings but which gun rights advocates say would outlaw commonly owned firearms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have countered with more limited proposals, including a bill that would </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB540" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exempt women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with active protective orders from restrictions on carrying firearms in certain locations and another that would </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB106" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lower fees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> charged by local law enforcement for processing concealed handgun permit applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But their prospects may be limited after losing all three statewide offices and seeing Democrats expand their majority in the House.</span></p>

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after being sworn in on Saturday, Gov. Abigail Spanberger <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2026/january-releases/name-1111231-en.html" target="_blank">appointed</a> members to the Boards of Visitors for George Mason University, the University of Virginia, and Virginia Military Institute. She also ordered a review of the higher-ed board confirmation process, which was the center of contention between lawmakers and the previous gubernatorial administration last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger’s actions come as the schools face multiple vacant seats on their governing boards and as the state weathers scrutiny from the federal government over its higher education institutions, which Democratic lawmakers pledged to protect from partisan influence. Spanberger’s nominees, like those of all governors, are subject to confirmation by the General Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Saturday, Spanberger directed the secretary of education, in consultation with the secretary of the commonwealth, to submit a report detailing the procedures for board appointments, including member term lengths, reappointments, term start dates for new members, and the evaluation process used by the Virginia Commission on Higher Education Board Appointments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Under the current federal administration, Virginia colleges and universities have faced unprecedented challenges from shifts in federal policy to attacks on institutional autonomy and mission,” Spanberger said in </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-6-Evaluating-Appointments-to-Public-University-Boards.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order No. 6</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “These pressures underscore the urgent need for the commonwealth to reevaluate how governing boards are appointed, ensuring they are composed of individuals dedicated to upholding the quality, independence, and reputation of our institutions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Democratic lawmakers clashed with Gov. Glenn Youngkin over his nominations to Virginia’s colleges and universities, with the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee rejecting 22 nominations largely because of conflicting ideals over diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers also questioned some boards’ decisions to align their policies more closely to ones outlined by the Trump administration and said they threatened Virginia institutions&#8217; autonomy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Strong governance is essential not just for protecting academic excellence, but for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ensuring that our colleges and universities continue to prepare students to thrive in an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasingly complex and competitive world,” she wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Richmond School of Law professor Carl Tobias interpreted Spanberger’s order as an opportunity to better the appointments process, put forward by a leader mindful of the current political environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The governor is aware and has witnessed … the apparent politicization of the boards especially at UVA and George Mason and so, I think this is her effort to see if there can&#8217;t be a better way to have the governor select these people to serve on the boards,” Tobias said, “and hopefully, in that way, improve the process of selection and then improve the governing capabilities of of the boards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tobias also said he is interested in whether the forthcoming report will address staggered terms. In Virginia, some K-12 schools use this method to keep some continuity on the board when the terms of members end before new members’ terms begin.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New appointees join boards at universities facing federal investigations, racism allegations</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger’s administration on Saturday announced 27 nominees to college boards — 12 to George Mason University, 10 to the University of Virginia and affiliates, and five to the Virginia Military Institute. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Democrats rejected 22 of Youngkin’s appointees to these boards, sparking a months-long battle that culminated in a Supreme Court appeal. Ultimately, the case became moot after the change in administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Congressmen Tom Davis, a Republican, and Jim Moran, a Democrat, top the list of Spanberger’s new nominees for George Mason’s Board of Visitors. The institution is under an ongoing U.S. Department of Justice civil rights investigation and faced allegations of racial discrimination in its hiring and admissions policies.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Amid federal investigations, George Mason leaders say negotiations continue with Dept. of Justice&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/12/05/amid-federal-investigations-george-mason-leaders-say-negotiations-continue-with-dept-of-justice/embed/#?secret=4uwFBJ5hQE#?secret=iS4uUUJEBM" data-secret="iS4uUUJEBM" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, Charles Stimson, who had been appointed as rector by Youngkin, stepped down, creating an opening on the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Spanberger shook up the University of Virginia’s Board of Visitors by asking several members to resign. She has nominated Carlos Brown, a former vice-rector, as well as Elizabeth Hayes, a UVA alumna and foundation board member. Mike Bisceglia, a business executive who served on Spanberger’s transition team, and Victoria Harker, who was nominated by former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell in 2012, also received nominations from the new governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite calls from Spanberger and others to suspend its search for a new UVA president, the board moved forward with selecting a leader, a decision leadership told lawmakers they weighed as necessary considering the time required to convene the full board and as they balanced the need for stability and leadership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The president search stemmed from a DOJ investigation that spurred former UVA President Jim Ryan’s resignation in June. Ryan </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/11/17/state-senators-may-call-uva-leaders-to-the-carpet-over-agreement-to-end-doj-investigations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in November that Rector Rachel Sheridan and Vice Rector Porter Wilkinson worked with the DOJ and Youngkin’s office to pressure him to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/06/27/uva-president-jim-ryan-resigns-amid-federal-ultimatum/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheridan neither disputed nor endorsed Ryan’s account at a Senate hearing on Jan. 12; instead, she focused on her own memory of the proceedings and said she and other leaders did what they believed was best for the institution.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wWyxLDe59s"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/13/va-senators-grill-uva-leaders-over-doj-deal-leadership-search-diversity-programs/">Va. senators grill UVA leaders over DOJ deal, leadership search, diversity programs</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Va. senators grill UVA leaders over DOJ deal, leadership search, diversity programs&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/13/va-senators-grill-uva-leaders-over-doj-deal-leadership-search-diversity-programs/embed/#?secret=ZZNb4qea1q#?secret=wWyxLDe59s" data-secret="wWyxLDe59s" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ and UVA signed an agreement to suspend five of the seven investigations, which center on the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion policies and allegations of antisemitism on campus. The agreement sparked concerns about federal overreach from Democrats and the UVA community. Two of the investigations have been closed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger also nominated former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam to join VMI’s governing board. Northam previously served on the board and completed his term in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2021 </span><a href="https://www.schev.edu/home/showpublisheddocument/1905/637919378545470000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted that “racial and gender disparities exist and that improvement is needed” at VMI, and said racial slurs and jokes are “not uncommon” on campus. The same report found the state’s oldest public military school “lags behind other Virginia institutions of higher education and other military academies in race and gender metrics and diversity efforts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simultaneously, the governing board selected Ret. Maj. Gen. Cedric Wins, the institution&#8217;s first Black superintendent, in April 2021. Four years later, Wins was ousted by the governing board composed of mostly Youngkin’s appointees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to being a new appointee to VMI’s board, Northam was the first governor in the commonwealth to create a DEI office in the executive branch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining appointees are a mix of alumni, business and civic leaders.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Next steps</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The review of the boards and commissions&#8217; nominations process, including a report and recommendations, is expected to be submitted to the governor prior to March 18 to inform decision-making and strengthen future appointments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House and Senate Privileges and Elections Committees are likely to take up the list of nominations by Feb. 17, the day of crossover when successful legislation is considered by opposite chambers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers will also consider </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB49" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 49</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which changes the nomination process by requiring that only fully confirmed individuals may serve in positions requiring General Assembly confirmation. The bill would end the current practice of allowing nominees to begin serving before confirmation, ensuring that only those who have received General Assembly approval hold such positions.</span></p>

(Photo courtesy of Henrico County Public Schools)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If at first you don’t succeed with legislation at the Virginia General Assembly, try, try … wait for a new governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the lesson for local officials, educators and state lawmakers when it comes to winning a reliable stream of money for major school construction projects around the commonwealth. It’s been well worth the fight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glenn Youngkin, whose term just ended,</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/02/14/school-funding-showdown-looms-as-legislature-sends-sales-tax-bill-to-youngkin-again/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">repeatedly vetoed proposals that would have allowed localities to add a one-cent sales tax</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earmarked for school construction and major renovations. (I chalk this up to Youngkin, a Republican,</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/02/24/governor-should-elevate-school-building-over-his-future-aspirations/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">being able to say he didn’t raise taxes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as governor when he inevitably runs for another electoral office.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only the city of Danville and the counties of Charlotte, Gloucester, Halifax, Henry, Mecklenburg, Northampton, Patrick, and Pittsylvania now have – following a voter referendum – the state’s blessing to raise the sales tax for capital school projects, due to the Dillon Rule. Those nine localities gained that ability before Youngkin became governor in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localities can raise real-estate tax rates on their own, but many other essential services like public safety and garbage disposal gobble up the money from that source. Officials who want to borrow money for school construction often run into bonding limits in their cities and counties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Abigail Spanberger, who was sworn in Saturday as governor,</span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2025-12-01/local-tax-option-to-pay-for-virginia-school-improvements-likely-to-succeed-in-2026" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">has said she would sign the latest legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if it passes both chambers this session. The measure, in the state</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB334" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB66" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, likely will win approval given the current Democratic majorities in both chambers, and because previous versions of the bill garnered bipartisan support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The need is only growing” in communities around Virginia, Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, told me. The sales tax option “adds a tool to help localities tackle the issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McPike is the chief sponsor of the Senate bill and has waged a long battle to make it a law. He also knows about the crumbling conditions in so many ancient buildings around Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He sits on the Assembly’s</span><a href="https://dls.virginia.gov/commissions/scm.htm" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Commission on School Construction and Modernization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In a report released in 2021, the panel found the total replacement cost for the 1,000-plus buildings then over 50 years old</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/02/03/if-it-wont-help-the-legislature-should-get-out-of-the-way-on-school-construction/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">was nearly $25 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Many school structures have gotten worse since then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve written before about some of the woeful conditions that existed: a </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/columns/article_f0ddbfa8-c582-11e8-add4-1bdb21d5a7ac.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collapsed 750-pound section</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of an auditorium ceiling in Norfolk; air ducts that operated so loudly in Portsmouth they competed with the voices of teachers; worn-out HVAC systems; roofs, floors and windows that</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/18/theres-no-logical-reason-to-deny-all-localities-a-funding-tool-for-school-building/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">are deficient in Stafford County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Youngkin’s credit, in his first year in office in 2022, the</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/10/youngkin-seeks-additional-290-million-boost-for-school-construction/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">General Assembly approved a historic $1.2 billion investment in school construction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, aimed at modernizing facilities and reducing funding disparities among school divisions. The plan had grants and loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loans, of course, have to be repaid. Besides, the needs across Virginia dwarf the amount of money the state has offered.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had previously claimed that, if the sales-tax increase became law, citizens would be on the hook for additional taxes of $1.5 billion annually. But as critics noted, you get to that figure </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">only</span></i> <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-sales-tax-school-construction-youngkin/article_cc9a10b8-ea49-11ef-bd08-cbf5154fb56d.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if voters in every locality approved the measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some of the state’s richer localities have enough revenue streams that they wouldn’t need the additional taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why so many communities are desperate to add this option for school construction. Several have publicly supported the one-cent sales tax in recent years – especially those with modest enrollments and limited tax bases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given the magnitude of the issue, it requires a holistic approach to solve it,” said Jeremy Bennett, director of intergovernmental affairs with the Virginia Association of Counties. The group supports the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some officials told me they currently must borrow money to complete major projects – which is part of the reason they often delay new construction and sizable renovations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It would be vital for us” if the tax proposal passed, said Zebedee Talley Jr., superintendent of the roughly 2,000-student Martinsville City Public Schools. Some sections of their five school buildings date to 1949.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The kids are deserving of this 1% tax,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince Edward County also is among the places favoring the proposal. The Board of Supervisors in December there cited estimates </span><a href="https://farmvilleherald.com/2025/12/26-legislature-priorities-adopted/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that the tax could raise $3 million in annual revenue based on recent collections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The division has about 1,850 students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one likes new taxes. I get that,” Donald (Chip) Jones Jr., superintendent of county schools, told me. But “this would allow us to take another revenue source. Anybody who shops or eats in Prince Edward County would contribute.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It never made sense that the Assembly granted nine localities this option but denied it elsewhere. Legislators and Spanberger should approve the measure for the rest of the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students, educators and administrators would thank them. </span></p>

(Photo courtesy Dominion Energy)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Construction has resumed on the $11.2 billion offshore wind project by Dominion Energy three weeks after the federal government called for a pause on the work citing national security concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal judge in the Eastern District of Virginia ordered a preliminary injunction on Friday for Dominion to continue work while the company’s lawsuit challenging the U.S. Department of Interior’s 90 day stop order continues.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion said in a statement that the company would continue working with the federal government on a solution while work restarts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CVOW is anticipated to bring on 2.6 gigawatts of energy — enough to power 660,000 homes at a time when the need is critical in the commonwealth. The project is already near completion with the first power expected to come online at the end of the first quarter of this year. That timeline is still on track despite the nearly three week delay in constructing the turbines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first of the 176 turbines were delivered by ship to the leasing area Saturday. The foundations for the turbines have already been installed and power will be rolled out on the project as the turbines are built. The entire project is anticipated to be completed by the end of 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of Virginia&#8217;s congressional delegation applauded the court’s decision to allow the project to move forward and accused the pause of being politically motivated. The Department of the Interior’s stop work order did not specify the national security risks and the defense department reports were classified. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine along with Reps. Bobby Scott (3rd-District) and Jennifer McClellan (4th-District) — all Democrats — released a joint statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(This) ruling is a victory for Virginians, who otherwise would face increased energy costs as a result of the Trump Administration’s shortsighted opposition to clean energy,” the statement read. “We will continue to work to protect this critical and growing industry and to ensure clean energy projects that have met every legal and regulatory requirement can move forward without undue political interference.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not the first federal intervention that has targeted offshore wind projects. Funding for multiple offshore wind related projects was pulled last year including an attempt to cut funds for the Norfolk Offshore Wind Logistics Port, also known as Fairwinds Landing, and the Portsmouth Marine Terminal Offshore Wind Development Project which aided the CVOW project. However, the funding had already been spent for those port upgrades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys general in multiple </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/trumps-offshore-wind-project-freeze-hit-with-lawsuits-from-states-and-developers" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">northeastern states have filed lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against the federal government to push back against funding cuts and similar pauses on renewable projects in their states. Virginia Attorney General Jay Jones stated in a release when he took office over the weekend, “My office will fulfill its duty to protect ratepayers and ensure the completion of Virginia’s landmark offshore wind energy project and ensure this federal overreach does not drive up energy costs for Virginians.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones’ office did not respond immediately when asked if Virginia would officially enter into the lawsuit filed by Dominion.</span></p>

Abigail Spanberger gives her first address to the joint General Assembly on Jan. 19, 2026 in Richmond. (Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two days after </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/17/spanberger-sworn-in-as-virginias-first-woman-governor-moves-swiftly-to-set-agenda/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taking the oath</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of office as the first woman to lead Virginia, Gov. Abigail Spanberger on Monday voiced strong support for a slate of constitutional amendments already approved by lawmakers and pressed for action on cost-of-living legislation, framing the moment as an early test of whether Virginia’s new political alignment can deliver results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her first address to a joint session of the General Assembly, Spanberger outlined her governing priorities and pressed for swift action on four Democratic-backed constitutional amendments, singling out a proposal that would allow lawmakers, under narrow circumstances, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/16/virginia-senate-democrats-advance-mid-decade-redistricting-amendment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to redraw congressional maps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mid-decade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She described the measure as narrowly tailored to counter what she said are growing efforts in other states to undermine democratic norms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia’s proposed redistricting amendment is a response to what we’re seeing in other states that have taken extreme measures,” Spanberger said, emphasizing that any change would be “short-term, highly targeted, and completely dependent on what other states decide to do themselves.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, she said, voters should have the final say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger also voiced strong support for amendments </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/19/virginia-lawmakers-send-reproductive-rights-amendment-toward-november-vote/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">protecting reproductive freedom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HJ3" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marriage equality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and automatic </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HJ2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoration of voting rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Virginians who have completed felony sentences — all of which will now be on the ballot in November. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have argued the measures are necessary to lock in rights they fear could be rolled back through future court rulings or shifting political control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond constitutional questions, the new governor used the address to press lawmakers to focus on affordability — an issue she repeatedly returned to as the defining challenge of her administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She pointed to rising housing costs, prescription drug prices and energy bills as pressures cutting across regions and party lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“More than 70% of Virginians say they cannot find housing they can afford to rent or buy,” she said, rejecting claims that affordability concerns are exaggerated. “This is not a hoax. This is real life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger said </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/17/spanberger-sworn-in-as-virginias-first-woman-governor-moves-swiftly-to-set-agenda/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive actions she signed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> immediately after her inauguration are intended to jump-start that effort, including orders directing agencies to identify ways to cut costs for families and to review regulations that slow housing construction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she also emphasized that lasting relief will require legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, she pointed to what she called an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/12/18/spanberger-makes-affordability-centerpiece-of-2026-agenda-as-legislative-session-nears/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Affordable Virginia Agenda,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> asking lawmakers to move a package of bills aimed at lowering costs in health care, energy and housing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposals include new rules governing pharmacy benefit managers to push drug rebates back to patients, targeted assistance to offset rising Affordable Care Act marketplace premiums, and incentives to recruit health care providers to underserved areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On energy, Spanberger called for expanded </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/08/solar-battery-storage-bills-make-a-return-after-previous-vetoes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy storage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, increased weatherization programs for low-income households and renewed commitment to a diversified power mix that includes solar, nuclear and offshore wind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She pledged to rejoin the </span><a href="https://www.rggi.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, saying its proceeds previously helped fund flood mitigation and energy-efficiency programs. Her comments come as Virginia’s offshore wind project has faced renewed uncertainty amid federal actions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing proposals outlined in the speech included extending the period tenants have to respond to eviction filings, giving localities more flexibility to adopt affordable housing programs and creating a revolving loan fund to finance mixed-income developments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans offered a competing affordability vision following the address. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, said House Republicans agree that lowering costs should be the General Assembly’s top priority and pointed to their newly announced the GOP’s “Affordability Done Right” agenda, which includes eliminating the grocery tax, phasing out the car tax, making the higher standard deduction permanent, lowering power bills and expanding auto insurance options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the governor “truly wants to make life more affordable,” Kilgore said, she should support those proposals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her speech, Spanberger also waded into debates over public safety and gun policy, calling on lawmakers to revive measures vetoed in recent years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said she respects the Second Amendment but urged passage of bills banning ghost guns, restricting firearm access for convicted domestic abusers and strengthening “red flag” laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are commonsense measures,” she said. “Virginia is ready. And I am ready to sign. Send them to my desk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education was another focal point, with Spanberger calling for higher teacher pay and renewed emphasis on reading and math instruction after Virginia ranked last nationally in math recovery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said her administration would avoid what she described as culture-war battles in classrooms and instead prioritize academic outcomes and partnerships between parents and educators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor also addressed higher education governance, announcing a review of appointments to boards of visitors and signaling support for reforms to prevent future administrations from politicizing university leadership — a topic that has generated intense scrutiny in recent months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woven throughout the speech was a warning about economic turbulence stemming from Washington, including federal job cuts, trade policies and their ripple effects on Virginia’s economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger said she has created an Economic Resiliency Task Force to assess the damage and recommend responses, particularly for displaced federal workers and rural communities affected by declining exports through the Port of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While emphasizing bipartisanship — noting she was ranked among the most bipartisan members of Virginia’s congressional delegation — Spanberger said she would not shy away from confronting federal actions she believes harm the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When federal actions attack and threaten Virginia jobs, I will not hesitate to push back,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She closed by invoking the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., whose holiday coincided with the address, urging lawmakers to reject political intimidation and dehumanization and to model a different approach to governance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Disagreement need not mean contempt,” Spanberger said. “Before anything else, we are all Virginians.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike two other civil rights-related constitutional amendments that passed with bipartisan support over the past year, Virginia’s reproductive rights measure has faced </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/01/21/amid-passionate-debate-civil-rights-resolutions-clear-virginia-legislature/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intense debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at every stage, with every Republican in the legislature opposing it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In defending her amendment for the final time, Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, emphasized that advancing the proposal would ultimately leave the decision to voters across the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ranging from fertility treatments to contraception access to the ability to obtain an abortion, “this amendment protects families’ entire scope of reproductive needs,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boysko and several other Democratic lawmakers have described how women in states with abortion bans have </span><a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/04/abortion-bans-pregnancy-related-death/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">died</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amid pregnancy complications. Those states have also seen an </span><a href="https://time.com/7297046/dobbs-supreme-court-abortion-doctors/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exodus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of OB-GYN physicians amid uncertainty of treating patients who need abortions or miscarriage management.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boysko grew tearful as she recounted </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/04/how-do-you-treat-a-person-who-isnt-the-standard-in-this-post-roe-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and advocacy shared by constituents and people around the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relatedly, Sen. Emily Jordan, R-Isle of Wight, struck a somber tone as she noted that “this is a difficult topic for a lot of people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the opposite side of the chamber’s aisle — and in opposition to the amendment — Jordan unsuccessfully attempted to modify the proposal to explicitly spell out care for babies when born. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sticking point for some Republicans has been concern that the amendment could be interpreted to allow abortion up to the “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/13/virginia-democrats-do-not-support-infanticide-but-heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-they-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">moment of birth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,”  though infanticide remains illegal under both </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter4/section18.2-71.1/#:~:text=Partial%20birth%20infanticide%3B%20penalty.,of%20a%20Class%204%20felony." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state code </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1531" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> federal law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Tara Durant, R-Stafford, also attempted for the second legislative session in a row, to reiterate existing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/01/17/parental-rights-at-center-of-reproductive-health-debate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parental consent laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Democrats and legal experts said it is unnecessary. Under Virginia </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title16.1/chapter11/section16.1-241/#:~:text=C.,person%20in%20violation%20of%20law.&amp;text=A%204;%20or-,3.,complained%20of%20in%20the%20petition." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, minors are required to have parental or guardian consent for an abortion unless they petition a judge for authorization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, accused Republicans of employing delay tactics by pressing for their amendments to the amendment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is a delay tactic,” Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Rockbridge, said on Friday, as he urged lawmakers to re-draft the amendment. Doing so, however, would restart the two-year process.</span></p>

Tara Durant, R-Stafford, speaks in opposition of a constitutional amendment on Jan. 21, 2025. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not entirely a partisan issue at the national level, the issue has increasingly fallen along party lines in states. That dynamic, Virginia Wesleyan University professor Leslie Caughell said, helps explain why Democrats are moving quickly while they hold legislative majorities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though placing language in the Constitution is difficult, it is also harder to undo. With </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/abortion-in-the-u-s-dashboard/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">every other Southern state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> imposing deep restrictions or near-total bans, bolstering Virginia’s protections has become a priority for Democrats. Providers and abortion funds in Virginia have also seen </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-abortion-funds-see-sharp-uptick-in-patients-both-in-and-out-of-state/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a surge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in out-of-state patients seeking care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think everything that happened in North Carolina made activists on this really uncomfortable,” Caughell said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, a member of the neighboring state’s legislature switched from Democrat to Republican, giving the GOP a </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/05/17/north-carolina-abortion-veto-override" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">veto-proof majority </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and paving the way for enactment of North Carolina’s current 12-week abortion limit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, Republicans have also put forward a range of abortion restrictions, from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/12/a-slap-in-the-face-va-house-gop-forced-to-reject-own-members-anti-abortion-bill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">near-total bans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/01/20/republican-senator-breaks-with-gop-to-oppose-15-week-abortion-bill-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15-week cap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that lacked exceptions for fetal anomalies — which are often not detected until </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/two-women-two-pregnancies-two-agonizing-decisions/article_24e5d5fc-742d-11ee-984d-6befc702d5d0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">around or after 15 weeks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On other reproductive health issues, a right-to-contraception bill has twice been </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/05/06/right-to-contraception-bills-highlight-key-reproductive-health-care-debate-in-this-years-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by former Gov. Glenn Youngkin — a point Boysko reiterated as the amendment advanced last week. </span></p>

Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, speaks with reporters about a a resolution she carried to enshrine reproductive rights into Virginia&#8217;s constitution on Jan. 16, 2025. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reproductive rights groups in Virginia, along with physicians and volunteers, have coordinated as part the national </span><a href="https://reproductivefreedomforall.org/news/reproductive-freedom-for-all-launches-5-million-electoral-program-to-mobilize-voters-and-protect-reproductive-freedom-in-2025-elections-including-activations-across-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reproductive Freedom for All </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">effort. Last year, a $5 million investment supported targeted initiatives ranging from canvassing to digital advertising in states such as Virginia, where Abigail Spanberger was elected governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger campaigned in part on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/09/09/on-the-record-abigail-spanberger/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supporting the amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though governors do not formally factor into its success or failure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I look forward to spending ample time in advance of the 2026 elections campaigning to make sure that people understand the importance of this constitutional amendment,” she told The Mercury last summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side, SBA Pro-Life America </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/06/24/anti-abortion-group-targets-democrats-to-stop-va-s-reproductive-rights-constitutional-amendment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supported </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia-based anti-abortion groups last year through door-knocking efforts in key House of Delegates districts that were up for election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats ultimately </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/11/04/blue-wave-rebuilds-the-house-democrats-soar-to-at-least-64-seats-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grew their majority </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by flipping additional seats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The abortion-opposing group “doesn’t have anything to share on the Virginia front at this time,” Communications Director Kelsey Pritchard said in an email, but the organization is monitoring Virginia among other states as it prepares to engage voters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians for Reproductive Freedom — which includes organizations like Repro Rising and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia —  will likely ramp up public engagement events and advertising as the November elections approach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caughell said she is watching closely to see how Virginia’s constitutional amendment campaigns intersect with this year’s congressional midterm elections. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/14/virginia-house-democrats-advance-four-constitutional-amendments-on-opening-day-of-2026-session/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — which include redistricting, reproductive rights, same-sex marriage rights and voting rights — arrive at a moment when Democrats may have an advantage, she noted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Midterm elections are often a referendum on the party that controls the White House, Caughell said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Republican President Donald Trump in the White House, GOP majorities in Congress, and </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/rising-trend/federal-fallout" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal funding fallouts affecting states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the amendments championed by Democrats could also help drive down-ballot votes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also noted that abortion, as a distinct health care need, has become a more salient argument in recent years, alongside economic considerations and support for personal choice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve expanded the parameters of our understanding of who this issue directly affects,” Caughell said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking with reporters outside the Senate chamber Friday, Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, emphasized that the work is not finished. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s our responsibility to go out there and tell the voters this is what this means and help everybody understand what they&#8217;re voting for,” she said.</span></p>

(Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Virginia grapples with an energy crisis fueled by the proliferation of data centers and growing local concern about permitting for the facilities, lawmakers are mulling how to manage the industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next two months of the General Assembly session, they will debate a slew of legislative proposals to streamline regulations, balance environmental priorities and address community concerns about the industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent poll by the Chesapeake Climate Action Network found that three quarters of voters blame data centers for rising utility costs and 9 in 10 believe that lawmakers need to take action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s no option to do nothing,” said Del. Michelle Maldonado, D-Manassas, who represents the region of the state where most data centers are concentrated and who has put forward a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB658" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have state regulators determine if ratepayers are being required to “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unreasonably subsidize” data center transmission costs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the challenges in regulating an industry like data centers is that Virginia holds local control in high regard. But with more counties giving approval to data centers to reap the rewards of increasing business and tax revenue, there is more pressure on the utilities to meet the power demands – the cost of which ultimately comes out of ratepayers’ pockets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers will debate how  the state can get the most out of the data center tax exemptions, expand on ratepayer protections following the new rate classes approved to the State Corporation Commission and get enough power on the grid to keep the lights on for everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the top data center bills of the 2026 legislative session so far. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">State Corporation Commission oversight</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A controversial method of regulation Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, is exploring through </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB155" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 155</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> looks to put additional reviews onto high load users over 25 megawatts, which describes most data centers and manufacturers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SCC would examine if proposed data centers and other high-load companies made sufficient contracts with renewable energy production and storage or have proper demand response measures. The bill also requires the SCC to make sure there is enough energy and transmission capacity on the grid to support the new project. A similar bill did not make it through the legislative process in 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said in a press conference ahead of the legislative session that there are many ways to address the energy demands that data centers present. He pointed to a number of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/12/environment-and-energy-groups-set-priorities-for-2026-legislative-session/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommendations by the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that are steps towards increased transparency and guardrails.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, has filed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB906" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB906</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to direct the SCC to form a work group tasked with finding ways to address energy load flexibility for the high load users. This is meant to help with grid strain and reliability and find other methods to ease grid demand. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Recovery cost</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SCC recently approved a new rate class for high-load users under Dominion. They will now be locked into 14-year agreements and  minimum demand charges for these users would be 85% for transmission, 85% for distribution, and 60% for generation. Some environmental advocates believe it is a good first step in ensuring that data center companies are paying a fair share of the transmission and generation costs for power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now lawmakers want to find more ways to relieve ratepayers from covering the cost of infrastructure that is primarily used by the data center industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. John McAuliff, D-Fauquier, has pitched </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB503" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 503</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would prevent utilities from putting the cost of transmission lines and energy generation that mostly serve data centers onto residential ratepayers. He hopes this will make the high load users chip in more for the infrastructure that is not providing power to homes and businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now the data centers are getting a pretty nice tax credit and we are paying for a lot of that infrastructure,” McAuliff said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s in the same vein as Maldonado’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB658" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She said that while the new rate class for high-load users will help keep rates fair, there is still concern about the cost recovery being added to bills through the individual riders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Without this legislation, families and small businesses can still end up subsidizing the infrastructure, the line substations and transmission projects needed for data centers, even if data centers are in a new rate class,” Sen. Russet Perry, D-Loudoun, said in a press conference.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Water use, putting waste heat to use</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public questions about how much local water is being used by data centers have bubbled to the surface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The servers inside of the warehouse-style buildings generate a lot of heat and need water to cool them down. Closed-loop hyperscale data centers are reported to use less water than the open loop systems. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB589" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 589</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Shelly Simonds, D-Newport News, would require water providers to report to the State Water Control Board monthly on the volume of water that the centers use.   </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB496" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 496</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Elizabeth Guzman, D-Prince William, would require data centers that are permitted by-right to report how much water the anticipated project would be using at the time of development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also some ideas on how to use the heat that is generated by the data centers. Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, is bringing </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB323" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 323</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to direct the Department of Energy to find ways to use the heat to either push it to surrounding buildings to the data centers as seen in other countries. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tax exemption requirements</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate democrats said in a pre-session press conference the state misses out on an estimated $1 billion from the data center industry through tax exemptions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surrovell said the state needs to benefit more from the industry utilizing the exemptions, either through potential energy efficiencies or other requirements. Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, is expected to file a bill this session on that issue similar to his </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/SB1196" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill from last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that did not pass out of committee.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Environmental impacts</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas, the delegate representing Prince William, said his constituents told him that there needs to be a minimum standard for data center locations, sound profile, and other environmental concerns. In response, he filed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB153" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 153</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would allow localities to require high energy users to complete a site assessment when they apply for permits for proposed projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas said this would be a way for county boards to get the full picture of how data centers or other projects may impact the surrounding community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can look in some localities like my own in Prince William County, where there are clear mistakes in siting. The Village Place Technology Park is a clear example, right next to the Village Place housing development that was there first,” Thomas said. “One vote ends up putting an industrial site way too close,” Thomas said, adding that one could throw a baseball from one of the homes’ back decks and hit the nearby data center. “And so that&#8217;s clearly inappropriate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A similar bill was vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin last year. At the time, the governor </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB1601/text/HB1601VG" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it would create too much red tape for the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been growing worries over the emissions from data centers’ diesel backup generators. Usually, they only run for a few minutes a month to test them unless there is an emergency situation. As the regional transmission managed by PJM is strained during hot and cold days – the grid operator is exploring whether data centers should hop off the grid to relieve some of the pressure. But that means the generators would run for hours at a time – releasing fumes into surrounding neighborhoods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas’ </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB154" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 154</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would require the facility to report publicly when the use of the emergency generators will be in use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I find that very dangerous and concerning for those of us that have high concentrations of data centers near our children and near our schools. So all the bill does is create more transparency,” Thomas said.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB130" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 130</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB607" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 607</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB507" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 507</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also zoom in on the diesel backup generators, offering limitations on how much they can be used and pushing the industry towards energy storage options as their backup method of power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many lawmakers believe it will take more than one session to work out the regulations around the multi-billion dollar industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s probably going to take a year, or two, or three to fully flesh out because there&#8217;s billions and billions and billions of dollars of assets and land investment out there, and we have to make sure we&#8217;re prudent about how we do it. But there&#8217;s no question, (the data center industry) is part of the problem, and we have to take it head on,” Surovell said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/17/spanberger-sworn-in-as-virginias-first-woman-governor-moves-swiftly-to-set-agenda/">Abigail Davis Spanberger</a> did Saturday in the first minutes of her term as governor soared past them all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not since the inauguration of L. Douglas Wilder as the nation’s first elected Black governor 36 years ago has the day been as heavily freighted with history as it was for Spanberger — the first woman to govern Virginia in more than four centuries as a colony or a commonwealth. Never had Virginians heard their leader speak as a daughter, a wife, a sister, a mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In content, tone and delivery, she comfortably and confidently rendered an address for the ages — one that rose to the importance of the occasion, rich in lines that will be quoted for generations to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Virginians, it blended the sweet optimism of President Ronald Reagan’s “</span><a href="https://www.c-span.org/clip/joint-session-of-congress/shining-city-on-a-hill--ronald-reagan-1988-state-of-the-union-address/4746361" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shining city on a hill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” valedictory and President John Kennedy’s stirring “</span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/2013/11/20/3650917/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask not</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” exhortation to Americans’ collective and individual commitment to country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under leaden skies against a damp winter chill, her sunny</span><a href="https://youtu.be/z2ue2kCsXTk?si=boZRcoHJHUMJdxHp" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">25-minute address</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> took in the vast sweep of Virginia’s history — for better and for worse — and paired it seamlessly to today’s divisive strife and tomorrow’s daunting challenges for her and her government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noted the commonwealth’s first two governors, Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson, and cited Henry’s 1799 admonition in</span><a href="https://www.redhill.org/speeches-writings/last-speech/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">his final public speech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — “United we stand, divided we fall” — that is as urgent now as it was at our republic’s birth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dressed in suffragette white and standing as the ultimate triumph of their cause, Spanberger saluted women who risked harassment and arrest on the same Capitol steps a century earlier advocating for women’s right to vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the eve of the holiday celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther King’s birthday, she noted King’s daring</span><a href="https://mlkcommission.dls.virginia.gov/kinginvirginia/richmond.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">1960 speech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Richmond urging Gov. Lindsay Almond to end Massive Resistance, Virginia’s disgraceful and futile effort to defy the Supreme Court’s</span><a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/brown-v-board-of-education" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">1954 ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to desegregate public schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In attendance on his</span><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/videos/abigail-spanberger-wishes-former-governor-175326720.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">95th birthday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Spanberger recognized Wilder, descended from enslaved grandparents, whose 1990</span><a href="https://youtu.be/7qpCJvrmmxs" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">inauguration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> packed Capitol Square — a realization of King’s dream.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_46247" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-46247" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7956-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7956-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7956-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7956-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7956-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7956-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7956-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Former Virginia Gov.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And she honored the memory of Linwood Holton, Virginia’s first Republican governor, who served notice in his 1970 inaugural speech that Virginia would, at last, embrace racial equality, not just as the law but as a value. Seated nearby, Holton’s daughter, former First Lady Anne Holton,</span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/spanberger-honors-linwood-holton-jan-17-2026" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">fought back tears</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as her husband, U.S. Sen and former Gov. Tim Kaine, comforted her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she shifted to the present, Spanberger confronted the administration of President Donald Trump and the “recklessness coming out of Washington” without once uttering his name. She addressed Virginians’ concerns head on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You are worried about policies that are hurting our communities, cutting health care access, imperiling rural hospitals, and driving up costs,” she said. Affordability was the centerpiece of her campaign and is now the focus of her term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You are worried about Washington policies that are closing off markets, hurting innovation and private industry, and attacking those who have devoted their lives to public service,” she said, referring to Trump’s schedule of punitive tariffs and federal job cuts in a state that is home to 330,000 federal government workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You are worried about an administration that is gilding buildings while schools crumble, breaking the social safety net and sowing fear across our communities, betraying the values of who we are as Americans, the very values that we celebrate here on these steps,” she said. No elaboration is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then she spoke without equivocation to the dispute roiling the nation, causing massive midwinter protests in cities across America, knowing her words might escalate the vindictive president’s reprisals. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were spotted operating last week in</span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/ice-petersburg-wednesday-jan-14-2026" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/henrico-officials-warn-about-ice-jan-16-2026" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Henrico County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And in Virginia,” Spanberger said, “our hard-working, law-abiding immigrant neighbors will know that when we say that we will focus on the security and safety of all of our neighbors, we mean them, too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does such a powerful oratorical start presage a successful term? Oh, were it so easy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has staked out an ambitious agenda, and she’s got 1,454 days and nights to achieve it. Many will be difficult, frustrating and thankless. There are unknown crises that, as often as not, hijack a governor’s term and define his — now </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">her</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — legacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at least for the moment, Abigail Spanberger has pointed Virginia toward a new destination, and she has inspired us to follow her there.</span></p>

(Photo by Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than a year after it was enacted, lawmakers will revisit a proposal that brought major changes to Virginia’s K-12 public school testing system, with the main debate centering on whether to keep or repeal a provision passed last year that requires assessments to count for 10% of students’ final grades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overhauling the testing system aims to raise student performance, strengthen outcomes and make the Standards of Learning (SOL) assessments in core subjects (math, reading, history and social science) more meaningful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/05/12/virginia-overhauls-sol-testing-to-boost-student-achievement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">changes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made to SOL testing to tie test scores to final grades, shift test timing, and give parents clearer results garnered widespread support in the General Assembly. However, some lawmakers, like Del. Kelly Convirs-Fowler, D-Virginia Beach, who opposed certain portions, argued the education community did not entirely support the revamp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Overall, it is meant to be an assessment of how these SOLs are being taught, if it&#8217;s working, and so it shouldn&#8217;t be a part of their grade,” said Convirs-Fowler, a retired educator, last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that “Standards of Learning are standards and the testing is what we&#8217;re using to assess that we&#8217;ve done what we&#8217;re supposed to do … and if we do that, then that&#8217;s the goal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the legislation carried by Del. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB1957" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Helmer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Fairfax, and Sen. Schuyler </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/SB855" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VanValkenburg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Henrico, took different measures to improve how the SOLs are administered and used to evaluate what students should know at the end of each grade or course. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VanValkenburg, a History and US Government teacher at Glen Allen High School, said he is aware of the Convirs-Fowler’s view, but had not spoken to her at the start of the session. He said the provision was intended to alleviate end-of-year testing and improve testing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the primary goal is to reduce overtesting by replacing separate teacher-led finals with standardized end-of-course exams, ensuring students face only one major cumulative test. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VanValkenburg said adding these scores to the final grades motivates students and gives them a clearer reason to take the exams seriously. He also said this provision reduces the burden on educators. Currently, teachers lose weeks of instructional time to repeated testing cycles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a teacher, it&#8217;s incredibly frustrating when the last five weeks of your school year are bogged down in repeated final exams,” VanValkenburg said. “It doesn&#8217;t make any sense to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Department of Education data showed modest gains in 2023-2024 reading and math pass rates. These gains followed targeted recovery efforts led by Gov. Glenn Youngkin and the General Assembly. Performance in other subjects stayed below 2022-2023 levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Convirs-Fowler was one of the few who voted against the legislation. This year, she is carrying </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB189" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 189</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which aims to repeal a law requiring students in grades 7-12 to have at least 10% of their final grade in a course determined by their SOL or local alternative assessment scores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia recently overhauled its accountability system, splitting its accreditation model into two systems: one to determine whether schools meet legal and regulatory requirements, and another to provide clear data on student and school performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott Brabrand, executive director of the Virginia Association of School Superintendents, said that with revisions to the state’s accountability system, Virginia now has multiple ways to track accountability without having to make the SOLs count for 10% of the student’s final grade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Standards of Learning are an important part of accountability, but they&#8217;re not the only part of accountability, especially in this new performance and support framework,” Brabrand said. “Additionally, SOLs are tied to a student’s graduation. Students have to get a certain number of verified credits to pass the SOLs. So really, this 10% final grade is adding an additional layer of accountability that really isn&#8217;t necessary.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future of Convirs-Fowler’s bill is uncertain, as </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB299" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helmer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB200" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VanValkenburg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have filed companion bills to refine their previous legislation. These changes focus on grading integrity, student eligibility for alternate assessments, test timing, and the public release of assessment materials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the highlights of the proposal include adding specific exemptions for students with significant cognitive disabilities and clarifying that parents and teachers are part of the team that decides whether a student should use an alternate test. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exceptions to the test timing were added for high school seniors in the final semester, students retaking tests and student transfers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">National exams, such as Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and College Level Examination Program (CLEP), would be exempt from the general limit of one assessment per academic quarter under the measure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal would allow school boards to request a case-by-case exemption to give a standard SOL test to an individual student, even if the rest of the class is taking a local alternative assessment, provided that the exemption does not exceed five percent of the students in that subject. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To protect the security of future exams, the proposal allows the board to release representative sample questions instead of a full past exam, if releasing the full exam would leave less than 70% of the question bank available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changes to the legislation are likely to affect the Board of Education’s efforts to revise how the state measures students’ performance in history and social science in the state’s </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/52591/638884565887170000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consolidated State Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social studies leaders have advocated for flexible, performance-based local assessments that allow educators to measure student learning in meaningful, varied ways while maintaining alignment with state standards. Such assessments balance accountability with recognition that students learn and demonstrate knowledge differently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed legislation would add safeguards for both mandatory and permissive local alternative assessments, including requiring permissive assessments to be graded in alignment with the “best practices” established by the Board of Education, which are slated to be made available to schools by Sept. 1, 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal also creates stricter rules for grading local alternative assessments, such as preventing teachers from grading their own students&#8217; work and ensuring students have no prior access to the test prompts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other bills that might impact testing on the docket. A measure being carried by Sen. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB16" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Suetterlein</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, R-Roanoke County, and Del. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB199" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Rasoul</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Roanoke, would give Virginia school districts more time and flexibility in how they test students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the commonwealth is rolling out a new testing system that measures student growth throughout the year. Sutterlein and Rasoul’s bill would allow schools to fully switch to the new system and continue using alternative tests until the 2027-2028 school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB1243" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1243</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sponsored by Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington, if a student fails an SOL test but quickly retakes it and passes, the school would count only the passing retake score when the student’s performance and the school’s overall rating and accreditation are considered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, a failing score can impact a school’s rating.</span></p>

Abigail Spanberger becomes the state's first woman governor as she is sworn in alongside her daughters and husband on Jan. 17, 2026. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Abigail Spanberger was sworn in Saturday as Virginia’s 75th governor, making history as the first woman to hold the commonwealth’s highest office and pledging to lead with unity, affordability and pragmatic action amid deep national divisions and growing uncertainty coming out of Washington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within hours of taking the oath, Spanberger, 46, moved swiftly to define the priorities of her administration, signing a package of executive orders aimed at lowering costs for families, strengthening public education, responding to federal disruptions and reshaping the internal operations of state government — an early signal that her tenure will be focused on affordability and what she described as “delivering results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing on the steps of the Virginia state Capitol in Richmond, Spanberger framed the moment as both historic and forward-looking, calling the peaceful transfer of power “a cornerstone of our American democratic experiment” and a defining feature of American democracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is the honor of my life to stand before you and take the oath today,” Spanberger said, underscoring the gravity of the moment and her responsibility to all Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She reflected on the generations who expanded democracy in Virginia — particularly women who fought for the right to vote and hold office — saying she stood before those “who could only dream of a day like today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger was sworn in alongside fellow Democrats Ghazala Hashmi, who took the oath as lieutenant governor, becoming the first Muslim woman to win statewide office anywhere in the United States, and Jay Jones, who was sworn in as Virginia’s attorney general, making history as the commonwealth’s first Black attorney general.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ceremony drew a cross-section of Virginia’s political leadership, including nearly all living former governors, from outgoing Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin to L. Douglas Wilder, the nation’s first elected Black governor, who celebrated his 95th birthday Saturday and whom Spanberger recognized during the event.</span></p>

Abigail Spanberger, the first woman elected to the office. (Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland and U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff, D-CA, were also in attendance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger thanked Youngkin and former first lady Suzanne Youngkin for their cooperation during the transition, as well as former Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, former Attorney General Jason Miyares and members of the outgoing administration for their service. The latter two did not attend the ceremony.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A historic oath, a forward-looking message</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of Spanberger’s inaugural address traced Virginia’s long democratic arc — from native sons George Washington and Patrick Henry to the suffrage movement and the Civil Rights era — but she repeatedly emphasized that the day was ultimately about the future Virginians will shape together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citing Patrick Henry’s warning that “United we stand, divided we fall,” Spanberger urged Virginians not to fracture into factions that threaten democratic institutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said the work of perfecting democracy has never been finished, but argued that Virginia’s history shows progress is possible when leaders and citizens confront challenges directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This square has been the scene of remarkable dramas of equality and justice,” she said, referencing suffragists who pressed their cause at the Capitol, the delayed ratification of the </span><a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-19/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">19th Amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the 1957 </span><a href="https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/prayer-pilgrimage-freedom" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pilgrimage of Prayer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also invoked moments when Virginia leaders confronted division head-on, quoting former Gov. Linwood Holton’s call to move beyond partisan camps and to “act together,” and highlighting Wilder’s 1990 inauguration as another milestone that reshaped expectations of who could lead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the address, Spanberger emphasized the meaning of Virginia as a commonwealth — a government designed to serve the common good — and framed unity as both a moral obligation and a practical necessity.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Executive actions underscore affordability focus</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The urgency of that message was reflected in Spanberger’s first official acts as governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The series of executive orders she signed after the swearing in were designed to confront rising costs, reinforce public education and prepare the state for potential disruptions tied to federal policy changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today, we are responding to the moment,” Spanberger said. “We are setting the tone for what Virginians can expect over the next four years: pragmatic leadership focused on lowering costs a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd delivering results.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first three executive orders focus squarely on affordability — an issue that she declared a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/12/18/spanberger-makes-affordability-centerpiece-of-2026-agenda-as-legislative-session-nears/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">centerpiece of her 2026 agenda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during a news conference in December.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One requires the governor’s secretaries and all executive branch agencies to submit reports within 90 days identifying immediate, actionable steps to reduce living expenses for Virginians, including housing, health care, energy, education, child care and grocery costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second establishes an Interagency Health Financing Task Force within the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Resources, charged with developing a unified financing strategy to reduce duplicative spending, maximize federal funding and strengthen Virginia’s long-term health care infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force is directed to assess programs most vulnerable to federal policy changes, review oversight of managed care organizations and evaluate shared technology, licensing and procurement systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A third directive launches a comprehensive review of housing development regulations and permitting practices, with the goal of eliminating unnecessary requirements and reducing barriers to housing production. It also creates a Commission on Unlocking Housing Production to recommend legislative, regulatory and administrative changes to increase housing supply statewide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Academic progress is the focus of a fourth executive order directing the Department of Education to strengthen literacy and math instruction, review accountability measures and expand access to advanced math coursework. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The directive calls for implementing recommendations from a </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt613.pdf#:~:text=(2024%E2%80%9325%20school%20year)%20SOURCE:%20Virginia%20Department%20of,or%20a%20policy%20option%20in%20this%20report." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2025 JLARC report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, advancing a next-generation assessment system and launching a statewide listening tour of educators, parents and students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other executive actions respond to external pressures, including federal workforce reductions, funding cuts, tariff impacts and immigration-related effects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One order establishes an Economic Resiliency Task Force to coordinate the state’s response, including managing potential disruptions to Medicaid and SNAP, supporting displaced federal workers and expanding agricultural and forestry exports amid tariff uncertainty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional orders initiate a review of the Board of Visitors appointment process for public colleges and universities; establish narrowly defined standby emergency authority for senior officials if the governor is unreachable; formally delegate operational authority to the governor’s chief of staff; and create a comprehensive equal opportunity and non-discrimination policy across state government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A tenth executive order rescinds Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-47-Keeping-Virginians-Safe-From-Dangerous-Criminal-Illegal-Immigrants.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 47</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which required and encouraged state and local law enforcement agencies to divert resources toward enforcing federal civil immigration laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The directive redirects law enforcement to focus on core public safety responsibilities, including investigating crime, staffing local jails and engaging with communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move aligns with a position Spanberger outlined during an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/08/27/spanberger-vows-to-scrap-youngkins-immigration-order-if-elected-governor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interview with The Mercury</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August, when she said she would move quickly as governor to end policies she argued pulled Virginia law enforcement away from their primary mission and strained already limited resources.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A personal case for pragmatic governance</h4>

Abigail Spanberger gives her first speech after being sworn in on Jan. 17, 2026. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia Mercury)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2026/01/17/full-text-of-spanbergers-inaugural-address/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inaugural address</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Spanberger did not name President Donald Trump, but repeatedly referenced federal actions and rhetoric she said were unsettling Virginians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know many of you are worried about the recklessness coming out of Washington,” she said, citing concerns over health care access, rising costs, attacks on public servants and policies she said betray American values.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She rooted her priorities in personal experience, describing her middle-class upbringing, her work as a federal law enforcement officer and her service as a CIA case officer focused on counterterrorism and nuclear proliferation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those roles, she said, reinforced the importance of accountability and service — lessons she now brings to the governor’s office. She also spoke as a mother of three daughters, emphasizing the strain rising costs place on families and the difficulty of planning for the future amid uncertainty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her policy agenda centers on affordability, education, economic growth and public safety. She pledged to tackle housing costs by cutting red tape and increasing supply, lower energy costs by ensuring high-volume users pay their fair share, and protect health care access while addressing prescription drug pricing practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she closed her address, Spanberger urged Virginians to consider how future generations will judge this moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Choose to stand united. Choose to serve one another. Choose to act together,” she said. “As we continue forward, let us be united for Virginia’s future.”</span></p>

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Senate Democrats on Friday approved a controversial constitutional amendment that would allow the General Assembly to redraw the state’s congressional districts mid-decade, advancing a long-simmering proposal they say is necessary to protect Virginia voters from partisan map changes unfolding elsewhere in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate voted 21-18 along party lines, just three days after lawmakers convened for the 2026 session, to pass the redistricting amendment alongside three others dealing with  reproductive health rights, voting rights and marriage equality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All four measures had </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/14/virginia-house-democrats-advance-four-constitutional-amendments-on-opening-day-of-2026-session/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already cleared the House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this week, putting them on track for a statewide referendum this spring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said Democrats brought the redistricting amendment reluctantly, but argued that developments outside Virginia left them little choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What you have before you today is a constitutional amendment that none of us wanted to bring to the floor, but circumstances beyond our borders have made it necessary,” Surovell said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He framed the proposal as a response to “unprecedented mid-decade redistricting” in Republican-controlled states, warning that Virginia’s current system could amount to “unilateral disarmament” if left unchanged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We worked hard. We worked diligently to establish a fair bipartisan redistricting process,” Surovell said, referring to the 2020 constitutional amendment that created the Virginia Redistricting Commission. “But we don’t operate in a vacuum today.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats cite temporary authority; Republicans warn of a return to gerrymandering</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the resolution that passed Friday, the General Assembly would be granted limited authority to redraw congressional lines between Jan. 1, 2025, and Oct. 31, 2030, but only if another state conducts mid-decade redistricting for reasons other than the decennial census or a court order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats emphasized that the authority would be temporary and narrowly tailored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans sharply disagreed, warning the amendment would unravel voter-approved protections against gerrymandering and open the door to broader map manipulation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, argued that Democrats would not stop with congressional districts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re going to redo the House of Congress. You’re going to redo the House of Delegates, and you’re gonna redo the state Senate,” Peake said. “We all know that is what is going to happen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the final vote, Democrats rejected an amendment offered by Sen. Chris Head, R-Botetourt, that would have required any new maps to be drawn by the bipartisan Redistricting Commission rather than the legislature itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Head urged lawmakers to remember the overwhelming support Virginians gave the commission just a few years ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sixty-six percent of the voters of Virginia voted in favor of the constitutional amendment,” he said, calling the current proposal a reversal of a hard-won consensus against political gerrymandering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surovell dismissed Head’s proposal as a procedural “poison pill,” saying even minor changes would doom the amendment. “Virginia voters will decide whether they want to give us the power to take action or not,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, lawmakers plan to draw new congressional maps during a special session, with Democrats pledging to release the proposed districts publicly before they go before voters. The amendment would appear on the ballot in a referendum expected in April, rather than during November’s midterm elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before either step can move forward, incoming Gov. Abigail Spanberger must approve both the new maps and the decision to shift the referendum to April. A spokeswoman for Spanberger did not respond Friday to a request for comment.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How the redistricting amendment took shape</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The path to Virginia’s mid-decade redistricting amendment  began abruptly in late October, amid a rare fall special session and growing national anxiety among Democrats over congressional map changes in Republican-controlled states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Oct. 27 — just days before the Nov. 4 statewide elections — Democratic lawmakers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/27/democrats-push-redistricting-amendment-as-special-session-jolts-virginia-ahead-of-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signaled plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to pursue a constitutional amendment that would allow the General Assembly to redraw Virginia’s congressional districts outside the traditional post-census cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal emerged during a special legislative session initially </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/15/after-more-than-600-days-va-lawmakers-adjourn-2024-special-session/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to address budget matters but quickly became a flashpoint as Democrats framed the move as a defensive response to Republican-led redistricting efforts elsewhere in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, Democrats argued that Virginia’s existing constitutional framework — which limits redistricting to once every 10 years following the census — left the state vulnerable if other legislatures manipulated maps mid-decade. Republicans countered that the proposal was a transparent attempt to gain a political advantage ahead of closely contested federal elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those tensions </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/28/democrats-republicans-clash-in-virginia-senate-over-timing-and-intent-of-redistricting-amendment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spilled onto the Senate floor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the next day, as lawmakers clashed over both the timing and intent of the amendment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans accused Democrats of exploiting a special session to fast-track a politically charged proposal with little public input, while Democrats maintained that the national landscape had changed rapidly enough to justify swift action. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The debate underscored sharp disagreements over whether Virginia should proactively arm itself against potential federal court rulings or partisan map changes in other states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also on Oct. 28, House and Senate Democrats </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/28/va-democrats-roll-out-redistricting-amendment-to-counter-gop-map-changes-in-other-states/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">formally rolled out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the language of the amendment, casting it as a counterweight to what they described as increasingly aggressive redistricting maneuvers by several Republican legislatures nationwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal would grant the General Assembly limited authority to redraw congressional districts mid-cycle, subject to voter approval, while preserving existing guardrails intended to prevent extreme gerrymandering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fight i</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/29/va-house-pushes-through-last-minute-redistricting-amendment-as-gop-cries-foul/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ntensified the following day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when the House of Delegates advanced the amendment in a last-minute push that drew fierce Republican criticism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOP lawmakers argued the move violated norms around constitutional changes and accused Democrats of rushing the process to avoid scrutiny. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats, however, said urgency was warranted, citing looming federal elections and uncertainty over how redistricting battles in other states might reshape the national political map.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the controversy, the amendment </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/31/virginia-senate-approves-mid-decade-redistricting-amendment-in-party-line-vote/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cleared another major hurdle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Oct. 31, when the Senate approved it in a party-line vote for the first time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because constitutional amendments in Virginia must be approved in two separate legislative sessions with an intervening election, the proposal returned to the General Assembly when lawmakers convened for the 2026 regular session earlier this week. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin reflected on his four-year term. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he prepares to hand the keys of the Executive Mansion to his Democratic successor, Gov. Glenn Youngkin says his four years leading Virginia exceeded even his own expectations — a tenure he describes as transformative, results-driven and largely free of regret.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an expansive interview with the Virginia Mercury on Thursday in the governor’s Cabinet Conference Room at the Patrick Henry Building in Richmond — less than 48 hours before Abigail Spanberger is sworn in as Virginia’s 75th governor — Youngkin framed his administration as one that fundamentally changed how state government operates, despite four years of divided government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I really don’t like the question about people’s legacy. What I think most about is, what is the impact that we’ve had on Virginia going forward,” Youngkin said. “And it really is a comprehensive transformation of the state, and where it’s going.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, a former private-equity executive who entered public office as a political outsider, said he rejected the idea that governors must limit their ambitions to a narrow set of achievable goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, he said, his administration pursued broad changes across nearly every area of state government — from education and public safety to economic development, behavioral health and core state services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We came in with a mindset of transforming the way government works, and defining success as delivering results as opposed to activity,” Youngkin said. “That transformation is not defined by a bill or a single program. It is a comprehensive effort that changes the way things are done and delivers results.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remarks echoed themes from Youngkin’s final </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/14/youngkin-touts-economic-education-gains-in-final-address-to-general-assembly/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State of the Commonwealth address</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wednesday, in which he highlighted record economic investment, regulatory rollbacks, education reforms and public safety initiatives.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A businessman governor grappling with divided government</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, 59, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/11/03/youngkin-wins-stunning-upset-as-gop-roars-back-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was elected in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by narrowly defeating former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, winning a then-purple state at a moment of pandemic-era frustration over school closures and remote learning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He governed for four years, with Democrats controlling both chambers of the General Assembly for part of his tenure — a dynamic that shaped both his accomplishments and his conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am encouraged by the fact that we have this comprehensive transformation … while we have a divided government,” Youngkin said. “Because we never had the General Assembly aligned with us. And we still were able to accomplish all of this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin said divided government forced negotiation but did not derail his administration’s fiscal agenda, pointing to budgets approved with bipartisan support and the ability to fund major initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We generated $10 billion in surplus revenue, $9 billion in tax relief, in a divided government,” he said. “We delivered the funding to support the transformation in education, and behavioral health, and made sure that we could change the way we do business development.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/03/25/youngkin-unleashes-veto-storm-to-drown-progressive-legislation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin used his veto power</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aggressively during his tenure — a fact Democrats say underscores how often the governor clashed with the legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said Youngkin struggled to define a clear governing vision and often prioritized cultural fights over affordability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He vetoed a record number of bills,” Scott said in an interview Thursday. “So what did voters do? They hired me to be speaker in the middle of his term, they fired his Republican speaker, and they gave us the majority.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott said Democrats frequently pushed back against what he described as Youngkin’s emphasis on cultural issues rather than kitchen-table concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The governor wanted less teacher pay; we got more teacher pay. He wanted less for health care; we got more for health care,” Scott said. “He spent most of his time fighting culture wars.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott said Youngkin’s rise was tied to a specific set of circumstances rather than a durable realignment of Virginia politics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think his legacy will be, for Virginia, that he was a flash-in-the-pan governor,” Scott said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite those disagreements, Scott said his personal working relationship with Youngkin improved after Democrats </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/08/virginia-democrats-triumph-in-statehouse-elections-reducing-youngkins-power/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">re-took control of the House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2023, and he credited the governor with making a consistent effort to engage once Scott became speaker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott said Youngkin regularly attended his weekly interfaith prayer breakfasts — early-morning gatherings held every Wednesday at 7 a.m. during the legislative session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He didn’t miss one, ever, when I was speaker,” Scott said. “So I give him a lot of credit for that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott also said he respected Youngkin for entering public life from a position of professional and financial success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He could have stayed rich and continued to do his thing,” Scott said. “But the fact that he put his name in the hat and entered the arena, I admire that as well.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Economic development and deregulation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the interview, Youngkin framed his record primarily around jobs, investment and what he described as a fundamental reshaping of how Virginia competes for business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pointed to what his administration says is $157 billion in committed capital investment, record job growth and a sweeping effort to reduce state regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I wrote that executive order on day one to get </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/07/08/youngkin-marks-early-success-on-regulatory-reform-sets-new-goal-for-35-reduction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">25% of our regulations either removed or streamlined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there was the big question, ‘Sir, how do we do this?’” Youngkin said. “And before you know it, we not only got through 25%, we got through 35% of regulations, streamlined saving Virginians $1.4 billion a year.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it’s still not clear exactly how his administration calculated those reductions, Youngkin emphasized that they were accomplished entirely within the executive branch. “There was no bill,” Youngkin said. “It was a managerial exercise.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also pointed to decisions by major companies to locate or expand advanced manufacturing and pharmaceutical operations in Virginia, including facilities announced by </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/09/astrazeneca-to-build-4-5-billion-manufacturing-hub-in-albemarle-county/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AstraZeneca</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/drug-manufacturer-eli-lilly-to-build-plant-in-goochland-create-650-permanent-jobs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eli Lilly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/20/merck-to-invest-3-billion-in-elkton-expansion-adding-up-to-500-jobs-in-shenandoah-valley/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merck</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These businesses, he said, “made a decision to come and build their futures, their largest facilities in the world, right here in Virginia. That ecosystem is now so strong that we’ll continue to see great companies come.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, said those corporate commitments — along with Youngkin’s sustained attention to Southwest Virginia — shape how the governor is viewed in much of rural Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think his legacy for Virginia is he’s been our job creator,” Kilgore told The Mercury in an interview Thursday. “On a personal note, he really helped Southwest Virginia during the disasters. He showed up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kilgore said Youngkin’s visibility during the devastating flooding spurred by </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/09/23/hurricane-helene-reshaped-parts-of-southwest-virginias-landscape-new-adaptations-are-underway/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hurricane Helene</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2024 and the ensuing human suffering left a lasting impression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Seeing him in action when people lost everything, and here Governor Youngkin was praying with them and talking to them — that was really impressive,” Kilgore said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education, behavioral health and public safety</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin said education reform was another defining feature of his administration, citing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/26/virginia-board-of-education-board-adopts-new-school-standards-of-accreditation-regulations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new accreditation standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, revised </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/09/04/as-dept-of-ed-prepares-for-new-academic-benchmarks-education-leaders-call-for-more-transparency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">academic benchmarks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/17/virginia-department-of-education-releases-final-cell-phone-free-guidelines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cellphone restrictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in classrooms and expanded </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/06/18/with-federal-funding-uncertain-va-faces-8-million-gap-for-attendance-teacher-retention-programs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tutoring initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We established expectations of excellence,” he said. “We overhauled the entire accreditation system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But some of Youngkin’s education changes drew sharp criticism, particularly his administration’s initial overhaul of the state’s K-12 history and social science standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early drafts </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/17/missing-context-political-bias-some-of-critics-objections-to-virginias-new-history-standards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">were widely criticized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by educators, historians and civil rights groups for omitting context on race and slavery and for what opponents described as political bias, prompting delays and significant revisions after a contentious public review process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also pointed to investments in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/12/14/youngkin-proposes-230-million-behavioral-health-overhaul/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">behavioral health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, calling the system “broken” when he took office and crediting his administration with fundamentally changing how services are delivered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veteran Virginia political analyst Bob Holsworth said those efforts may be among Youngkin’s most durable accomplishments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think he can take some credit for making further progress on addressing the behavioral health issues in Virginia,” Holsworth said. “And he was very popular in Southwest Virginia for the fact that he showed up a lot.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Holsworth argued that Youngkin’s governing style relied heavily on executive authority rather than legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you look at his legacy, he has no legislative legacy. What you saw on Wednesday was a list of executive actions,” Holsworth said, referring to Youngkin’s final speech before the joint legislature this week, where he touted his accomplishments.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Controversies and regrets</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked whether he regretted any decisions, Youngkin said he did not — though he expressed frustration over the collapse of a proposed Northern Virginia sports and entertainment complex, which </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/12/nova-arena-proposal-runs-into-trouble-as-top-senate-democrat-presses-pause/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Democrats blocked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amid opposition led by Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It would have benefited Virginia hugely,” Youngkin said. “And it was blocked wrongly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal would have brought an estimated $12 billion in economic development and 30,000 jobs, according to the administration. Opponents said it wasn’t a project citizens should be responsible for financing, and pointed to possible </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/02/study-finds-arena-plan-would-need-135-to-215-million-in-transportation-investments/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transportation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and environmental challenges with the arena plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also defended his approach to higher education governance, where his board appointments at UVA and other institutions </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/08/28/senate-committee-democrats-block-14-more-youngkin-appointees-from-va-college-boards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sparked partisan battles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m so proud of the board work that our team has done,” he said, criticizing Senate Democrats for blocking nominees he described as highly qualified.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump, national politics and political fallout</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin rejected the premise that he distanced himself from Donald Trump during his 2021 campaign, saying Trump’s 2016 victory influenced his decision to run while his own race remained focused on state issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the primary influences on my decision to do that was the fact that a businessman named Donald Trump had stepped out of his life, run for president, and won,” Youngkin said, echoing sentiments he shared in a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-touts-trump-as-fellow-outsider-republican-businessman-at-republican-national-convention/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">speech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the Republican National Convention in 2024 where Trump became his party’s nominee for president. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In my race, the key was focusing on state issues, local issues, and not a federal race, because at the end of the day, governor is a state job.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin said his relationship with the Trump administration during the president’s second term benefited Virginia through preserved grant funding and federal cooperation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holsworth said that embrace ultimately proved costly for Republicans in Virginia, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/11/04/democrats-sweep-virginias-statewide-races-reclaiming-full-control-of-executive-branch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">who lost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all three statewide races in November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That turned out to be a debacle of historic proportions for his own party,” he said. “He essentially made the Democrats’ argument.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott echoed that view, saying Youngkin’s political pivot was noticeable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It took him almost four years to begin mentioning Trump’s name,” Scott said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Leaving office</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he prepares to leave public office, Youngkin said he was surprised by how much his administration was able to accomplish — and by how much he enjoyed serving alongside his wife, Suzanne, whose work on fentanyl prevention he repeatedly praised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I didn’t expect we could get this much done,” Youngkin said. “I had ambitions and dreams of what we might be able to do, but I was told by everybody, there’s no way you could do it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With his term ending and a transition underway, Youngkin said he is ready to step away from public office, at least for now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re taking a break,” Youngkin said. “Suzanne and I are going on vacation to an undisclosed location.”</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/species/amphibians/pdfs/Yellow-spotted-woodland-salamander-Plethodon-pauleyi-petition.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eleven groups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> petitioned the agency in 2022 to protect the yellow and purple critters that are found in shale and sandstone rockfaces in West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Those habitats have frequently been subject to blasting for mountaintop removal mining. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit alleges that the agency has missed the mandated timeline of 12 months to conduct assessments on species that could qualify for the endangered or threatened lists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fish and Wildlife Service </span><a href="https://www.fws.gov/press-release/2024-01/10-species-get-initial-reviews-endangered-species-act-petitions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found in 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there is a possibility the salamander may qualify for special protections under the Endangered Species Act. It stated in the January 2024 release that a review would begin. But it has been two years and a decision has not been made on adding them to either list to get critical habitat protections –  which prompted the group to file the lawsuit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are some of the most imperiled salamanders on the planet and they can’t wait any longer for protections,” said Will Harlan, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Without federal action these salamanders will go extinct on our watch.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conservation groups fear that much of the salamander’s populations have been wiped out due to mining and road construction in the mountains where the species is solely found. The petition estimated that only about 200-400 of the salamanders remain across its range. If they were listed as endangered species, then their habitat would be safeguarded by law and require the federal government to create a plan on how to boost the population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petitioners identified that the yellow-spotted woodland salamanders not only experience habitat loss but are faced with disease, pollution, and invasive species challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Appalachia is a global biodiversity hotspot for salamanders, with more salamander species than anywhere else in the world,” the Center said in a release about the lawsuit. “Today 60% of salamander species are threatened with extinction.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes as the Department of Interior recently announced plans to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/proposed-change-to-federal-endangered-species-rules-could-impact-virginia-animals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">roll back portions of the Endangered Special Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Those changes would narrow what could be considered critical habitat and potentially limit the species that can be placed on the protection lists.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renewing the subsidies has been a paramount debate among federal lawmakers for months, spanning last fall’s government shutdown and persisting into the new year. Last week, when the U.S. House </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/09/repub/us-house-backs-extension-of-health-insurance-subsidies-after-dems-force-vote/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">greenlit a measure to extend the credits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for three years, U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, was the only GOP member of Virginia’s congressional delegation to join the state’s Democratic representatives in voting to pass it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wittman was one of just 17 Republican congressional representatives nationwide to support the three-year extension effort. The bill still has to pass the Senate and then be signed by President Donald Trump — a </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/08/nx-s1-5662625/house-vote-affordable-care-act-subsidies" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vocal critic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the credits. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What are ACA tax credits and where are they being used in Virginia?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The subsidies, formally called the Enhanced Premium Tax Credits, help people purchase insurance through the Affordable Care Act. The 16-year-old federal law created government-run marketplaces for people without employer-provided insurance, but who earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid, to be able to buy coverage. The special credits make health care accessible for millions living in lower income brackets around 100 to 400% of the federal poverty level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That includes Williamsburg-area resident Natlie Tyer, who said she is able to maintain health insurance thanks to the credits, while she works part time and finishes her master’s degree to become a school counselor. Tyer attends William and Mary in Williamsburg, a historic city in the 1st Congressional District, which Wittman represents. About 30,000 people living there have utilized the subsidies, according to SCC data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked to explain his vote, Wittman said he was thinking about his constituents when he aligned with his Democratic colleagues to advance the measure to extend the credits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This vote was about responsible governance — protecting families from sudden cost increases today while fighting for better, conservative solutions tomorrow,” he said in a statement emailed to The Mercury after declining a phone interview request. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mercury followed up by email asking for more details about health care solutions Wittman would like to seek beyond what he called the “strictly temporary” extension of the subsidies, but did not receive a response by the time of this publication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With higher premiums, financially burdened people have been left with the choice to pay more for health care or forgo it and risk being without insurance in case of medical emergencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the subsidies are not renewed, Tyer has said she may have to go without health insurance coverage in the upcoming year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do I just rely on a strategy of hope until I graduate from grad school, and I get a job in the public school system?” she asked in an interview last summer.</span></p>

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Wittman emerged as the lone congressional Republican in Virginia to side with Democrats on the matter, his colleague in the 2nd District, Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/09/23/virginia-democrats-and-some-republicans-want-to-extend-aca-tax-credits-as-shutdown-looms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pressed for one-year extension </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the subsidies. She voted no on the latest effort to resurrect the credits because the House proposed a three-year extension, she</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2026/01/09/kiggans-no-vote-aca/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told The Virginian Pilot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political analyst Bob Holsworth said that “Kiggans voted her beliefs, and one can always credit somebody for doing that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But,” he added, “I think politically this was a damaging vote.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He noted that Democrats have eyed the districts as potentially flippable, at a time where both affordability issues like health care and a referendum on Trump can motivate people to the polls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Trump-backed reconciliation bill Congress passed last sumer is expected to cause thousands of Virginians and millions nationwide to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/21/virginia-hospitals-clinics-brace-for-federal-health-care-changes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lose Medicaid health coverage </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and changes to hospital funding mechanisms could trigger service cuts or closures. Eventually, people with private insurance could see </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/09/03/federal-state-lawmakers-call-on-va-hospitals-to-be-transparent-about-federal-funding-changes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rate raises </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">as hospitals will occasionally negotiate with private insurers to offset costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Wittman and Kiggans </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/06/30/hospital-associations-in-va-13-states-warn-against-proposed-cuts-to-medicaid-and-hospital-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">had been outspoken</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against previous versions of the bill but ultimately supported it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of people who aren’t affected (by ACA or Medicaid) are still concerned about affordability and the votes of somebody on these high profile issues can kind of leak over into the broader affordability issues as well,” Holsworth said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those reconciliation bill changes, however, won’t fully kick in until after the congressional midterms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, the ACA subsidy debate is not yet over. While Trump has signaled he would </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/trump-says-he-may-veto-extension-obamacare-subsidies-2026-01-12/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">likely veto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the matter should it get to his desk, Republican Ohio Senator Bernie Moreno plans to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/12/bernie-moreno-obamacare-talks-00719585?nid=0000018f-3124-de07-a98f-3be4d1400000&amp;nname=politico-toplines&amp;nrid=7c3d92a8-e08c-4389-83e4-f2d150eeaec1" target="_blank">lead the charge</a> to bring the credits back to life on his side of the aisle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreno has framed supporting the extension as a way to align with Trump&#8217;s motto of putting “America first.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To triage immediate financial injury to Americans and Virginians, Wittman described his vote as a short fix for now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Allowing those costs to spike overnight would have punished working families while doing nothing to fix the underlying problems in the system,” he said. </span></p>

(Photo by VCU Capital News Service)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the first day of the 2026 legislative session, Virginia lawmakers on Wednesday finally adjourned the 2024 Special Session, officially ending a meeting that lasted 612 days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the midst of a budget battle after the regular legislative session wrapped, Gov. Glenn Youngkin called lawmakers to Richmond for a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/13/5-things-to-know-about-virginias-newly-revealed-budget-deal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">special session</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> starting May 13, 2024, to resolve differences between the governor’s and lawmakers’ spending plans. The special session then remained open because the Senate never gaveled out, creating an ongoing opportunity for lawmakers to address the budget — and other matters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia redraws its congressional districts every 10 years after each census. But last fall, Democratic lawmakers put forward a constitutional amendment to allow the legislature limited power to redraw the state’s congressional districts. It is a strategy to bring Virginia in line with</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/08/08/repub/why-congressional-redistricting-is-blowing-up-across-the-us-this-summer/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other states that are redrawing voting districts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for political leverage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Donald Trump praised states like Texas for their mid-cycle redistricting efforts last summer, in an effort to bolster the GOP majority in Congress ahead of midterm elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said the 2024 special session’s achievements included passing a bipartisan budget that prioritized education — including teacher raises and more k-12 public school funding— and other Democratic priorities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But sending the redistricting amendment to voters was also a key victory, Scott said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m proud of the fact that we were able to get the redistricting amendment completed,” Scott said at a Wednesday press conference. “We put it in front of voters, and they knew about it. Now, voters are watching Virginia — not only in the commonwealth, not only in the United States, but all over the world — to see if America has lost its damn mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added, “I think we have an opportunity now to send a message to the rest of the country that we&#8217;re not going to stand by while you rig this election. We will do everything in our power to level the playing field we were talking about.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Republican Caucus Chairman Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, said failing to end the session was a move to keep the governor from making his nominations to multiple boards and commissions, and not the “purported purpose” of addressing the budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said one reason Senators were able to reject the 22 appointments to three public university governing boards last year was because the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee was able to meet while the Senate was still in session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve been in a special session almost continuously during the course of Governor Youngkin&#8217;s term, which is really unprecedented,” Obenshain said. “It was used to keep the governor from making appointments (and) that was largely what it was used for. There was nothing that would have prevented the legislature from being called back, had it been necessary to do so, but we have just entered this hyperpartisan phase in which we&#8217;re gonna try and prevent governors from exercising their constitutional prerogatives.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Minority Leader Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, told reporters on Wednesday that he understands the need for a special session on the state budget, but was disappointed that time was spent developing the constitutional amendment to redraw congressional districts right before the gubernatorial election in November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results favored Democrats, who will now control the governor’s mansion in addition to the House and Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hopefully, we&#8217;ll get beyond where we have to be in a special session all the time,” Kilgore said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Caucus Whip Del. Michael Webert, R-Fauquier, agreed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We went into a special session to solve a very specific problem. It was not meant to be used as a tool to continuously identify issues and keep what they&#8217;re doing,” Webert said. “We shouldn&#8217;t (have been) in two sessions at the same time (and) because of that confusion, I believe … it delegitimizes specific legislative processes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, was pleased with the legislative work completed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m very proud of the progress we were able to make, even with the obstruction of a Republican governor who </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/03/25/youngkin-unleashes-veto-storm-to-drown-progressive-legislation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a historic number of important bills that Virginians really needed,&#8221; Price said.  &#8221;I&#8217;m really looking forward to the bills (that) we&#8217;ll be able to pass and actually get a signature on this time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed constitutional </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HJ4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which will be considered by both chambers, would allow voters to give the legislature the authority to redraw the lines as early as this year. The General Assembly must approve the measure during two consecutive sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, added more context about the purpose of Virginia Democrats’ redistricting push.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m glad we were able to be in session to protect American democracy, which is what this redistricting amendment is about. We didn&#8217;t want to have to redraw congressional districts, but when a bunch of … Trump Republicans want to figure out a way to keep themselves and Trump in power as long as possible, it became necessary for us to figure out a temporary solution to address that before our bipartisan redistricting commission can act again in 2031.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2024 special session also addressed the reversal of cost-cutting measures to the Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program, which provides tuition-free college for some military families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators also wrestled with measures on skill games in the 2024 special session. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/SB195" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New</span></a> <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB271" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create a commission that would oversee skill games and other forms of legal gambling in the state have been introduced in both chambers in this year’s session, which is set to adjourn March 14.</span></p>

(Photo by Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><em><strong>By Katherine Hafner/WHRO</strong></em></p>
<p>For decades in Virginia, public and private developers who encroach on protected wetlands and streams have been required to offset the impacts by paying to restore similar ecosystems nearby.</p>
<p>The Virginia Department of Transportation, for example, had to buy many credits to compensate for construction to expand the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel.</p>
<p>The process, called mitigation banking, operates as a marketplace where builders and restoration groups trade credits.</p>
<p>But it has become somewhat of a black box, said Jonathan Rak, chief policy advisor for the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a very inefficient market. It&#8217;s not transparent,” he said. “It&#8217;s very difficult for the participants to see what&#8217;s available, what the price of credits has been. That means that there are some very wild fluctuations from place to place within Virginia and from time to time.”</p>
<p>The state <a class="Link" href="https://swan.waterledger.com/what" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>recently launched a website</u></a> to streamline the market by making this information more accessible. It’s produced in partnership with Water Ledger, a technology company focused on water management.</p>
<p>The Stream, Wetland and Nutrient Credit Exchange, or SWaN, allows anyone to toggle through an interactive map and dashboard to find available credits by watershed and type, such as tidal or non-tidal wetlands.</p>
<p>Market participants can register to use the platform more deeply for trading and research. Eventually, Virginia will charge subscription fees to recoup the cost of launching the website, which was about $500,000, Rak said. The basic website will remain free.</p>
<p>The new platform does not change the way mitigation banks are permitted or operated in Virginia, he said. It’s meant to make it easier for people to move through the process, allowing wetlands to be built more quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>The wetland credits system is governed by state and federal regulations.</p>
<p>Mitigation banking gained momentum locally in the 1990s. The national practice was formalized in 2008 through joint regulations by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>First, developers must prove they can’t avoid ecosystem impacts, Rak said. When they’re deemed necessary, mitigation is required.</p>
<p>Permittees can restore or build new wetlands if they find an appropriate site. Otherwise, they typically pay a nonprofit or private company to create the mitigation bank, or purchase credits available from an existing one.</p>
<p>The credits system is somewhat opaque for members of the public, but it has drawn more attention in recent years from people concerned about development and land conservation.</p>
<p>Residents near Pleasure House Point in Virginia Beach, for example, <a class="Link" href="https://www.whro.org/environment/2025-03-19/virginia-beach-begins-clearing-more-than-5-000-trees-at-pleasure-house-point" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>unsuccessfully fought against the city’s plans</u></a> to convert a section of maritime forest into wetlands to earn mitigation credits.</p>
<p>City officials said they could not find readily available credits on the open market and needed them quickly to complete flood protection projects elsewhere in the city. Residents conducting research claimed they found other credits that the city could have used instead.</p>
<p>Surry County residents <a class="Link" href="https://www.whro.org/environment/2025-01-23/surry-county-residents-concerned-about-wetlands-project-that-could-drain-sunken-meadow-pond" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>voiced concerns last year</u></a> about a planned wetlands bank by the nonprofit Nature Conservancy that could drain the beloved Sunken Meadow Pond.</p>
<p>Last summer, environmental groups in Hampton Roads <a class="Link" href="https://www.whro.org/environment/2025-06-13/environmental-groups-in-hampton-roads-at-odds-with-army-corps-over-proposed-wetlands-mitigation-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>spoke out against an Army Corps decision</u></a> for a mitigation bank in Prince George County. The groups argued that the project should not be allowed to sell credits in Hampton Roads, because it’s too far from the impacted ecosystem.</p>
<p>The SWaN platform could be used in such situations to provide more transparency for all involved, Rak said.</p>
<p>The credit system could also soon shift because of changes at the federal level.</p>
<p>A 2023 Supreme Court decision, Sackett v. EPA, narrowed the scope of the Clean Water Act, changing the definition of wetlands such that fewer areas will require mitigation. But Virginia’s regulations remain the same.</p>
<p>“There will be an increasing number of permits we expect that will be solely issued by Virginia and will not involve the federal regulations,” Rak said.</p>

Glenn Youngkin looks into the gallery of the House of Delegates before delivering his final State of the Commonwealth speech on Jan. 14, 2026. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his final State of the Commonwealth address Wednesday evening, outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin offered a sweeping defense of his four-year tenure, arguing that Virginia is stronger economically, fiscally and educationally than when he took office in January 2022, as he prepares to hand power to Abigail Spanberger, who will be sworn in as the state’s 75th governor this weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking before a joint session of the General Assembly, Youngkin framed his farewell address as both a victory lap and a warning — praising bipartisan cooperation where it occurred, but urging lawmakers not to undo core policies he credits for economic growth, particularly right-to-work laws, tax cuts and his administration’s approach to energy and education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the state of the commonwealth that I have had the immense honor of serving these past four years,” Youngkin said, thanking lawmakers and Virginians as he prepares to leave office. “By every single metric, today Virginia is stronger than she has ever been.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, a Republican elected in 2021, entered office amid the COVID-19 pandemic’s aftermath, school closures, rising violent crime and economic uncertainty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He repeatedly contrasted those conditions with what he described as a “Great Virginia Renaissance,” asserting that his administration reversed population loss, restored job growth and stabilized state finances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among his central claims was that Virginia has attracted more than $157 billion in business investment during his term, which he said exceeds the combined total of the previous six administrations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pointed to major projects involving companies such as LEGO, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca and Hitachi, along with recent manufacturing announcements in Southside and the Piedmont.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia, he said, is “a winning state,” with nearly 270,000 more people working now than when he took office and tens of thousands of additional jobs in the pipeline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those investments, Youngkin argued, are directly tied to policies that future lawmakers should preserve, including Virginia’s right-to-work law, which prohibits mandatory union membership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Change Right to Work and jobs will disappear,” he warned. “No amendments. No reforms. No changes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also emphasized record state revenues, citing more than $10 billion in budget surpluses over four years and roughly $9 billion in tax relief enacted during his administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said December revenue numbers showed continued growth, allowing for additional tax cuts alongside expanded funding for education, Medicaid, public safety and capital projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those budget decisions have been a point of contention for Democrats, who argue that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/18/youngkin-unveils-ambitious-budget-proposal-for-his-final-year-as-governor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">repeated rounds of tax cuts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> risk limiting long-term investments and question whether recent revenue surpluses are sustainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education was another cornerstone of Youngkin’s address, particularly his administration’s response to pandemic-era learning loss. He cited Virginia’s ranking near the bottom nationally in reopening schools when he took office and claimed the state has since led the nation in math recovery and reductions in chronic absenteeism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were 46th in the nation to reopen our schools,” Youngkin said. “The learning loss was devastating.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He credited bipartisan legislation, including the </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/k-12-standards-instruction/english-reading-literacy/literacy/virginia-literacy-act" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Literacy Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and investments in tutoring, lab schools and career and technical education, for improved outcomes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Youngkin, four out of five Virginia high school students now graduate with a credential or certificate, and teacher pay has increased nearly 20%, contributing to a sharp drop in vacancies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those reforms have also drawn scrutiny, with ongoing disputes over testing standards, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/01/virginia-education-board-approves-six-more-lab-schools-to-aid-students-is-the-process-too-quick/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lab school governance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and parental rights policies championed by Youngkin, including restrictions on school mask mandates and curriculum content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public safety and behavioral health featured prominently as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin said violent crime, including murders, has declined roughly 30% statewide during his term, crediting law enforcement funding, anti-gang initiatives and fentanyl enforcement. He highlighted </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2025/november/name-1071326-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 59% reduction </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in fatal fentanyl overdoses, attributing the drop to tougher penalties, public awareness campaigns and expanded access to naloxone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On behavioral health, Youngkin touted what he called a complete system overhaul, citing major expansions in crisis beds, mobile crisis teams and the 988 hotline. The administration’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-celebrates-launch-of-pilot-program-meant-to-aid-mental-health-crises/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right Help, Right Now” initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has drawn bipartisan praise but also questions about workforce shortages and long-term funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy policy marked one of the sharpest contrasts with Democrats and the incoming administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin reiterated his opposition to rejoining the </span><a href="https://www.rggi.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and urged lawmakers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/10/04/youngkins-energy-plan-calls-for-reevaluation-of-clean-economy-act/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to repeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Virginia Clean Economy Act, arguing that renewable energy mandates alone cannot meet Virginia’s growing demand, particularly from data centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to double our generating capacity in the next 10 years. Renewables alone, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will drive up costs and risk brownouts, just can’t get it done,” he said, calling for expanded natural gas and nuclear power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have countered that abandoning clean energy targets would undermine climate goals and increase long-term costs, a debate likely to intensify under Spanberger’s administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin closed his address with a reflection on Virginia’s role in the nation’s upcoming 250th anniversary, linking his administration’s emphasis on “commonsense” governance to the state’s founding legacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It has been the honor of a lifetime for Suzanne and me to serve,” he said. “We have strengthened the spirit of Virginia — together.”</span></p>

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia House Democrats wasted little time flexing their new majority on the opening day of the 2026 General Assembly, pushing through four proposed constitutional amendments Wednesday aimed at reshaping some of the state’s most consequential political and civil rights debates — including one that would allow lawmakers to redraw Virginia’s congressional map mid-decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measures, approved after clearing the House Privileges and Elections Committee earlier in the day, seek to protect abortion rights, restore voting rights for people with felony convictions, remove a defunct ban on same-sex marriage and — most controversially — grant the General Assembly limited authority to modify congressional districts outside the traditional 10-year redistricting cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All four amendments now head to the Senate, where Democrats also hold the majority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Democratic leaders framed the aggressive opening-day push as a response to recent national court rulings, partisan redistricting battles in other states and what they described as an urgent need to let voters — not politicians or courts — decide the future of fundamental rights.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Redistricting amendment draws fire</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most politically charged of the four measures is </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HJ4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Joint Resolution 4</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a proposed constitutional amendment that would create a narrow, temporary exception allowing the General Assembly to redraw one or more congressional districts outside the standard decennial cycle under specific circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the proposal, lawmakers could act if another state redraws its congressional map mid-decade for reasons other than complying with a state or federal court order. The authority would apply only to congressional districts — not state legislative lines — and would expire in 2030.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats argue the amendment is necessary to counter aggressive Republican gerrymanders elsewhere that could tilt control of Congress, while Republicans call it a blatant power grab that undermines Virginia voters’ 2020 decision to create an independent redistricting commission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This amendment creates essentially a narrow, temporary exception,” said Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, the measure’s sponsor. He emphasized repeatedly that the proposal does not automatically redraw any lines and does not eliminate the Virginia Redistricting Commission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are not expanding the authority to change the state district lines,” Willett said. “We’re just talking about congressional lines. And more importantly, it does not change any of the lines as they exist today — this just creates the process to consider doing that.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">April special election timeline</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the amendment ultimately passes the Senate this session, it would be placed on the ballot during a special statewide election in April, rather than waiting until November — a compressed timeline that Democrats say reflects the urgency of ongoing redistricting fights across the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“​​We’re going to focus on today so we’ll get that out of the House and the Senate,” said Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, chair of the House Privileges and Elections Committee, during a news conference Wednesday morning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And then we are looking at a special election for a statewide referendum to have the voters have their say in potentially April. And then once that kicks in, if the voters were to give us that power, we would then be looking at a modified schedule for the primaries, and then our November elections will happen as scheduled.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have warned that the move could open the door to dramatic changes in Virginia’s congressional delegation. Democratic leaders have openly discussed the possibility of drawing a map that would yield </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/13/virginia-redistricting-democrats-republicans-seats-00723660" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as many as 10 Democratic-leaning districts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, leaving just one Republican-friendly seat anchored in Southwest Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, rejected that characterization of the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not a 10-1 state, we’re not a 9-2 state,” Kilgore told reporters Wednesday morning. “We’re a close, 6-5 state, and some of those congressional seats are very competitive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have also tried — unsuccessfully — to stop the amendment in court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A judge in Tazewell County on Tuesday </span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/court-rejects-gop-request-to-block-virginia-redistricting/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rejected an emergency request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from GOP lawmakers seeking to halt the General Assembly from advancing the proposal before the session began. </span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-01-13-Order-denying-plaintiffs-motion-for-temporary-restraining-order.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the judge emphasized that courts cannot interfere with the constitutional amendment process while it is still underway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Plaintiffs’ motion at its core requests the Court to invade the province of the Legislature prior to the final actions of the Legislature,” the judge wrote, citing long-standing separation-of-powers principles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court also rejected an attempt to bypass legislative immunity by targeting legislative clerks, finding they were simply performing their official duties.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Sharp debate in committee</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During Tuesday’s committee debate, Republicans warned the amendment reverses reforms voters approved just four years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re using this ‘end justifies the means’ method,” said Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington. He argued that the amendment was improperly introduced after the 2025 election season </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/27/democrats-push-redistricting-amendment-as-special-session-jolts-virginia-ahead-of-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">had already begun</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and pointed to social media posts showing potential maps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It concerns me that we’re attempting to go back to the battle days of gerrymandering,” O’Quinn said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats countered that the amendment preserves flexibility without mandating any outcome and ultimately leaves the decision to voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This does not change any of the lines as they exist today, this just creates the process to consider doing that, but it does not mandate that these lines be changed,” Willett said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Other amendments headed for November</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the redistricting proposal is expected to dominate debate this spring, the other three amendments are slated to appear on November’s ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One would remove a 2006 ban on </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HJ3" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">same-sex marriage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Virginia’s constitution — language that has been unenforceable since the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling but remains on the books. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporters say the amendment is a safeguard should the court revisit marriage equality, something Justice Clarence Thomas suggested after the court overturned federal abortion protections.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HJ2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would automatically restore voting rights to people with felony convictions who have completed their sentences. Virginia is one of the few states where former felons permanently lose voting rights unless restored by the governor, a process critics say </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/23/these-virginians-wont-be-able-to-vote-next-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lacks transparency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third and most divisive proposal would </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HJ1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enshrine reproductive rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the state constitution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It advanced last year </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/01/21/amid-passionate-debate-civil-rights-resolutions-clear-virginia-legislature/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amid emotional floor debates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, shouting and a call of “out of order” in the Senate chamber, and has only moved forward because of Democratic control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every Republican lawmaker has opposed the abortion amendment, and GOP leaders have previously backed near-total bans or a 15-week limit without exceptions for fetal anomalies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the fall of federal protections, Virginia has become the only Southern state without extensive abortion restrictions, leading to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-abortion-funds-see-sharp-uptick-in-patients-both-in-and-out-of-state/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a surge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in out-of-state patients seeking care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the redistricting amendment, final approval of all three measures would rest with voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price said the package of amendments reflects how interconnected the issues before lawmakers have become, particularly amid recent actions by President Donald Trump and Republican-controlled legislatures across the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“‘There is no such thing as a single issue struggle,’” she said, referencing a quote from civil rights activist Audrey Lorde. “We do not lead single-issue lives, and I feel like that is more true today, now than ever in my lifetime, because of the actions of Trump and Republican-led state legislatures.”</span></p>

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the eve of the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/12/what-to-watch-as-virginias-2026-general-assembly-returns-to-richmond/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2026 General Assembly session</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Senate Democrats on Tuesday rolled out an ambitious agenda centered on lowering the financial strain on Virginia families, while signalling openness to revisiting tax and revenue policy amid looming budget pressures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats control both chambers of the legislature, which is set to convene Wednesday with affordability at the forefront of lawmakers’ priorities, amid broader economic and policy debates facing the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a news conference in Richmond, party leaders outlined what they called the “2026 affordability agenda,” a package aimed at easing costs for households across sectors including healthcare, childcare, housing, energy and food access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The framework builds on the Affordable Virginia blueprint </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/12/18/spanberger-makes-affordability-centerpiece-of-2026-agenda-as-legislative-session-nears/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unveiled last month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger, who has made cost-of-living issues a central theme of her early legislative push.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the course of the last year, one of the things that we kept hearing about was the rising costs among families,” said Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, chair of the Senate Democratic Caucus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Families across Virginia are being squeezed by rising costs from housing and health care to childcare and everyday necessities, and they deserve relief. The urgency of this moment is not lost on us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Locke said the agenda will rest on eight pillars that also include transportation, job and food access, energy and education, aimed at restoring “hope, freedom and opportunity for working families” in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, tied the affordability push directly to economic pressures he attributes to federal policy shifts, including tariffs and energy costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a sweeping critique of national trends, Surovell said rising prices for essentials such as food and utilities underscore the urgency of the legislature’s work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The truth is, President Trump’s policies are failing Virginians, and the question now is whether we’re going to let that happen, whether we’re going to do something about it,” Surovell said, previewing a slate of Democratic proposals that would raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2028, create paid family medical leave and expand collective bargaining rights for public employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surovell also addressed the state’s fiscal outlook, noting that new federal tax law changes — part of the so-called </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One Big Beautiful Bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed by Congress last year — could cost Virginia roughly $1 billion in revenue if the commonwealth conforms its tax code to the federal structure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature must decide within the first two weeks of session whether to align state tax policy with the federal changes, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we can form our tax policy to what Congress asks us to do, it costs us a $1 billion of revenue,” Surovell said. “We’re going to have to make a decision in the first two weeks whether or not we can conform to the federal tax law or not.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that after adjustments for K-12 and Medicaid spending, Virginia is facing a $3 billion to $4 billion funding gap before new initiatives can be considered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among potential revenue discussions are modernizing elements of the state’s tax structure, Surovell said, including reexamining the sales tax base and whether existing income tax brackets are equitable in a changing economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the Senate’s president pro tempore, echoed the centrality of affordability while placing it in the broader context of opportunity and long-term prosperity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going to frame affordability and (it’s) inseparable from freedom and opportunity,” Lucas said, naming access to quality education, health care and workforce development as key components of sustainable economic mobility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic agenda dovetails with wider General Assembly expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affordability resonated with voters across Virginia in the 2025 elections, helping deliver Democratic a sharp increase of the party’s House majority and shaping policy priorities for 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger’s earlier rollout of the Affordable Virginia Agenda mirrored her </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/09/09/on-the-record-abigail-spanberger/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign promises</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and framed the session as an opportunity to tackle prescription drug costs, utility bills and housing challenges, with a focus on measures to restrain runaway costs without overburdening the state budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the ambitious scope of Democratic proposals has drawn scrutiny from critics who argue that some measures — such as broad regulatory changes and spending mandates — could backfire by shifting costs elsewhere in the economy or increasing burdens on businesses and ratepayers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/ripple/2026/01/06/virginia-governor-abigail-spanberger-affordability/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggested that certain affordability strategies may inadvertently raise costs through cross-subsidization or expanded mandates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond affordability, Democrats and Republicans alike are preparing for debate on other high-profile issues such as constitutional amendments, redistricting procedures and structural reforms in areas like energy policy and worker protections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Virginia’s Constitution, constitutional amendments that passed for the first time last year must be approved again in the coming weeks before moving to voters later in 2026, making this session particularly consequential.</span></p>

(Photo by Imaginima/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s ever-growing fleet of data centers will take the spotlight when the General Assembly reconvenes this week. Along with bills addressing issues like energy use and siting, legislators will need to address a problem that received little attention in previous years: the diesel generators that provide backup power in emergencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Northern Virginia, where most data centers are concentrated, millions of people are exposed to air pollution from thousands of massive diesel generators. Air toxins permeate the surrounding area every time these generators are run for routine testing and maintenance, with greater levels of pollution when they all kick on at once in a grid emergency. As more data centers go up in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/12/16/loudoun-residents-take-fight-against-high-voltage-power-lines-for-data-center-alley-to-scc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suburban neighborhoods</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and close to schools, residents fear that their health, and that of their children, is being sacrificed to Big Tech’s AI ambitions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ongoing </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sp7DV4DIN_iZN91WGBPkf8Ua-SEm4Kzk/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">led by Dr. Damian Pitt at Virginia Commonwealth University, using data from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), shows pollution from data centers currently makes up a very small but growing percentage of the region’s most harmful air emissions, including CO, NOx and PM2.5. (In pollution, the automobile is still king.)  Already the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appendix </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to the report, using 2023 data, shows significant impacts to neighborhoods around data centers in Loudoun and Prince William counties, exceeding emissions from other high-pollution facilities in the region. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_46162" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:1468px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-46162" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-13-at-2.16.08 PM.png" alt="" width="1468" height="1320" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-13-at-2.16.08 PM.png 1468w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-13-at-2.16.08 PM-300x270.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-13-at-2.16.08 PM-1024x921.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-13-at-2.16.08 PM-768x691.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1468px) 100vw, 1468px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(Map courtesy Damian Pitt/Virginia Commonwealth University research team)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as the research team noted, the total </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">allowable</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> emissions under DEQ permits is far greater, and this also keeps growing with construction of each new data center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And those are annual limits, which could be met with very high emissions on a limited number of days. It’s not hard to imagine the health crisis that might accompany a grid emergency causing all of the area’s generators to fire up at once on a hot summer day, perhaps when smoke from wildfires is already pushing air quality into the hazard zone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the problem grows with every new data center that’s built, each one requiring backup power on site. In Virginia, diesel is the fuel of choice, most of it burned in so-called Tier II emergency generators with no pollution controls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past year, large operators have started installing Tier IV generators in addition to Tier II generators. The Tier IV have some pollution controls and are not restricted to emergency use. They are subject to the same annual emissions limits, but as long as they stay under the permitted level there is no limit on how much they can run. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new trend suggests that operators who install these non-emergency generators either think their Tier II generators may be used so much in the future that it will put the data center at risk of exceeding the permit’s annual air pollution limits – which would be bad – or they intend to use the Tier IV generators outside of emergency situations – which might be worse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, it appears operators expect to burn a lot more diesel fuel in coming years. One Amazon </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/28094/638778027138400000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">permit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I reviewed contemplates a single data center using up to ten million gallons of diesel fuel annually for 173 generators. All that diesel fuel is delivered by diesel trucks, which adds to the region’s pollution but isn’t limited by the permits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why so much? DEQ </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/27430/638730583843800000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from January 2025 indicates that data centers have two to three levels of redundancy in their generator capacity – that is, backups for the backups, so operators never have to fear losing power if some of the generators won’t start. As a result, there is more generator capacity than data center load. Together, Northern Virginia’s 4,000-plus diesel generators </span><a href="https://broadbandbreakfast.com/dateline-ashburn-data-centers-drive-new-energy-disputes-in-northern-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">add up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to over 11 gigawatts of energy capacity – exceeding Dominion Energy’s entire natural gas fleet, and enough to power millions of homes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, they don’t power millions of homes. They are used only for data centers, and when all goes well, they aren’t used at all. These thousands of generators just sit around doing nothing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, this is the cheapest possible way to ensure data centers never lose power, but it’s hard to believe they can’t do better. If there is redundancy anyway, data centers ought to be using batteries or other storage as their first line of defense in an outage, reserving Tier IV for second-line backup and eliminating Tier II generators altogether. Typical lithium-ion batteries provide four hours of electricity, enough to cover most backup needs and still leaving room to help the grid meet peaks in demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A (very) few operators </span><a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/batteries/aligned-data-center-get-online-faster?amp%3Butm_medium=email&amp;%3Butm_campaign=canary&amp;_hsmi=387019570&amp;utm_source=newsletter" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are in fact doing this</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but unless Virginia acts to require it, Big Tech has little incentive to prioritize clean backup power. The use of diesel generators offloads the true cost of backup power onto residents in the region, who pay in the form of worse health outcomes and a lower quality of life. Evidently that suits the tech companies just fine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While residents</span><a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/virginia/blog/2026/01/looser-rules-dirtier-air-data-centers-and-diesel-pollution-virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> demand an end</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the pollution, Virginia’s government has been going in exactly </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/12/16/virginia-regulators-weigh-expanded-use-of-data-centers-polluting-generators/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the opposite direction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This fall, DEQ </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/l/GDocForum.cfm?GDocForumID=2798" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amended a guidance document</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to allow Tier II generators to run </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> often. DEQ achieved this by changing the definition of “emergency” to include planned power outages, such as might occur when a utility schedules work on a substation that supplies electricity to a data center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ cut some </span><a href="https://www.princewilliamtimes.com/localnews/despite-hundreds-of-complaints-va-eases-its-rules-on-dirtier-data-center-generators/article_4739de1c-04fc-4843-8b8b-7494b7531ad0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legally-questionable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> corners to get this change finalized two weeks before the end of Glenn Youngkin’s term as governor. When word got out, more than 500 people submitted comments online and by email, overwhelmingly opposed to easing generator restrictions. Only a small handful of commenters supported the change, mainly the data centers themselves and a couple of their chamber of commerce allies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ didn’t respond to ordinary residents, but the </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13BcVbEOcBG8wVuNCklCrKA41xD7PSEby/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it mailed to what seems to have been a select few commenters was unrepentant. DEQ did not even acknowledge the suggestions that it require batteries instead of allowing the increased use of the dirtiest diesel generators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pressure will now be on the General Assembly to tackle the issue. This session will likely see the reintroduction of legislation offered in 2024 and 2025 by Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, and Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/02/10/facing-data-center-sprawl-and-an-energy-crisis-virginia-lawmakers-leap-into-action-just-kidding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">limiting or banning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the use of diesel generators at data centers as part of larger bills addressing their energy use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this year a new Loudoun County Democrat, Del. John McAuliff, has introduced </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20261/HB507" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring data centers to use storage as the first line of defense in emergencies, limiting Tier IV generators to emergency use when storage is exhausted, and removing the option of Tier II generators altogether. The bill also adds air monitoring and public notification requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No doubt the data center lobby will resist these measures, as they have absolutely every initiative that would require them to shoulder the cost of their presence in Virginia. Their allies in the General Assembly will fret that requiring Amazon to prioritize cleaner alternatives to diesel generators might raise costs incrementally for a multinational company and its billionaire chief. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That feels increasingly out of touch. In November a Virginia government </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt611.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calculated that the data center industry received more than $2.7 billion in incentives over the past decade, thanks to Virginia taxpayers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It shouldn’t be any surprise that now the taxpayers would like a little consideration in return.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 8 p.m., </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Gretchen Bulova defeated Republican Adam Wise in <a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/house-of-delegates-11/district/" target="_blank">House District 11</a> by 69.7–29.8% out of 5,932 votes cast, according to unofficial results from the Virginia Department of Elections. Bulova will succeed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> her husband, former Del. David Bulova, who retired his seat after being </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/12/11/veteran-environmental-legislator-david-bulova-selected-as-virginias-next-resources-secretary/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tapped last month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as Virginia’s next secretary of natural and historic resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/house-of-delegates-23/district/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House District 23</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Democrat Margaret Franklin defeated Republican Vern Robinson by 77.2–22.6% out of 6,428 votes cast, filling the seat vacated by Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/12/10/spanberger-taps-del-candi-mundon-king-as-virginias-next-secretary-of-the-commonwealth/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">who is joining</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Spanberger’s cabinet as secretary of the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two contests were the latest in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/more-special-elections-loom-in-virginia-house-amid-democratic-turnover/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a series of special elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> triggered by lawmakers leaving the General Assembly to serve in Spanberger’s administration. Democrats have so far managed to defend each of the vacated seats, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/06/democrats-retain-two-richmond-area-seats-in-back-to-back-special-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maintaining their majority</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the House of Delegates and the state Senate as the new governor prepares to take office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the districts in Tuesday’s elections lean Democratic, Republicans had hoped the off-cycle contests might present an opening to flip at least one seat amid typically lower participation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We congratulate Delegate-elect Gretchen Bulova and Delegate-elect Margaret Franklin on their special election victories in HD-11 and HD-23,” House Democrats said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As the General Assembly prepares to get to work, we look forward to serving alongside them, rolling up our sleeves, and delivering strong, responsible leadership that meets the moment and delivers for Virginians across the commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HD-11, located in northern Fairfax County, has long been a Democratic stronghold. The district backed Democratic candidates at every level in recent statewide elections and is home to a large number of federal workers and college-educated voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gretchen Bulova enters the House with deep ties to the district and state politics. She previously served as a member of the Fairfax County School Board and has worked as an advocate on education and environmental issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the campaign trail, she emphasized continuity with her husband’s record, highlighting priorities such as public education funding, environmental protection and transportation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Bulova, a veteran environmental legislator first elected in 2005, was selected by Spanberger to lead the natural and historical resources secretariat, overseeing agencies responsible for environmental regulation, conservation and historic preservation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His appointment was part of a broader effort by the incoming governor to draw experienced lawmakers into her cabinet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HD-23, which covers parts of Prince William County, has also trended Democratic in recent cycles as the region has grown more diverse and suburban. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Franklin campaigned on a platform centered on public education, health care access and economic opportunity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A longtime community advocate, Franklin has worked with local nonprofit organizations and emphasized her experience navigating state and local systems on behalf of families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her victory ensures Democrats retain control of a seat that King had represented since winning it in a 2021 special election. King’s move into the administration created the vacancy that Franklin will now fill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday’s outcomes mean Democrats have successfully defended multiple seats vacated by lawmakers joining Spanberger’s cabinet, reinforcing the party’s strong hold on the House as the 2026 legislative session approaches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another special election is scheduled for Jan. 20 in </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/house-of-delegates-17/district/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House District 17</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also in Fairfax County, where Democrat Garrett McGuire will face Republican Christopher Cardiff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both are vying to succeed Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/12/23/appointments-of-two-key-cabinet-roles-will-trigger-another-special-election-in-house-district-17/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">who is set to become</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia’s next secretary of finance in Spanberger’s administration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients with coughing, sneezing, fever or a runny nose are “strongly encouraged” to wear a mask and to notify the front desk of their symptoms when visiting provider offices, urgent care centers or emergency rooms. This recommendation is for people whether or not they’ve had their flu or COVID-19 vaccines recently. Additionally, some hospitals require masking for all patients and visitors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HCA Virginia, Centra, VCU Health, UVA Health, Bon Secours and the Children’s Hospital of Richmond at VCU made a joint announcement revealing their mask guidelines Tuesday to help reduce spread of illness where the hospital chains operate. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The joint release from Virginia hospitals noted that vaccination “remains the most effective way” to reduce risk of severe illness, even though they are not 100% effective. That’s why the hospital systems urge people to mask up when they fall ill and stay home if they can.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear what role Youngkin administration officials played behind the scenes. But their actions produced a letter and revised easement that helped the stalled project to proceed, as </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/06/17/louisa-county-landowner-caught-up-in-solar-farm-regulation-debate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proposed by citizens met challenges in other rural areas of the state.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November, the solar farm was </span><a href="https://www.fredericksburgfreepress.com/2025/11/06/king-george-supervisors-approve-solar-project-on-land-owned-by-county-attorney/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unanimously approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the county’s board of supervisors. Stuart serves as the county attorney, but recused himself from being involved in the board’s debate of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stuart, a close political ally of the GOP governor, said in an interview the long road to building the solar farm was frustrating because he shared the goals of conservationists who opposed the project. He said the solar farm involved a small sliver of his 1,431 acres, on land that he said his ancestors had once owned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m protecting 1,430 acres — a thousand acres of timber, 300 and some acres of marsh,” Stuart said. “Yet they just beat you up if you try to do anything. And I don&#8217;t understand that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stuart worked with the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation since at least 2022 over his plans to lease 122 acres of his land to TerraForm Power, which plans to build </span><a href="https://www.caledon-solar.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 22 MW solar farm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Stuart’s land is governed by an easement — in this case, an agreement between a landowner and DCR designed to “encourage preservation of open space land.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2001 easement, signed by a previous landowner, forbids most industrial or commercial activities. But Stuart pointed to a later, 2017 management agreement he signed with DCR that lays out how the easement should be implemented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2017 agreement explicitly allowed solar facilities “so long as any such project is in accordance with the Conservation Easement and/or Deed of Dedication.” Stuart maintained that because the project sat on an exclusion zone, outside of the heart of the easement, he should be allowed to lease the land to TerraForm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The argument failed to persuade former DCR director Matthew Wells, who gently rejected Stuart’s plan in an August, 2023 letter. Wells said Stuart needed to work with DCR to amend the easement in order to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wells also sought the opinion of the U.S. Department of the Interior, whose grant funded the easement. In a June 21, 2024 letter, an official at the department said they believed the solar farm was incompatible with the easement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Stuart was undeterred. In a July 8, 2024 letter to Wells, Stuart threatened to proceed with the solar facility and vowed “swift legal action” if the state tried to stop him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stuart said he was “most distressed by your comments to me that you must treat me differently because of ‘who I am.’” In an interview, Stuart said Wells had told him he needed to hold Stuart to a higher level of scrutiny given his status as a public official (Wells, who left DCR in October, did not respond to a LinkedIn message seeking an interview).</span></p>

(Photo by Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stuart cc’d Richard Cullen, Youngkin’s counsel, then-Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources Travis Voyles, and two men he described in an interview as attorneys who’ve represented him in legal matters: Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, and attorney Thomas Wood IV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little over two weeks later, on July 26, 2024, Voyles responded to Stuart with a letter that struck a different note: “Solar energy development is specifically permitted in certain areas of the property, where it is consistent with the easement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TerraForm representatives referenced Voyles’ letter in hearings in front of the county’s planning commission, which nonetheless recommended against approving the project in September. Two months later, the five-member BOS opted to approve the project anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not clear what changed with the state’s treatment of the solar facility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stuart said he can’t remember if he spoke directly with Cullen during that period, but said “it would certainly make sense if we talked,” pointing to his threat of legal action against the state. He said he’d known Cullen, an attorney and mainstay in Virginia and national Republican politics, for years, but would’ve alerted any governor’s counsel in the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cullen did not respond to an email and phone call seeking comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Mercury filed a public records request about the matter, the governor’s office said it was withholding 24 pages of text messages, emails and call logs between Stuart and Cullen during the period between Stuart’s warning letter and Voyles’ response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also withheld “half of a manilla file” worth of emails and text messages between Cullen and Voyles containing the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">keywords &#8220;solar&#8221; or &#8220;Stuart.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, DCR and Stuart signed an amended easement that explicitly allows solar facilities and cites Voyles’ letter as rationale for the changes.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_46169" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-46169 size-medium" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-13-at-2.20.51 PM-300x244.png" alt="" width="300" height="244" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-13-at-2.20.51 PM-300x244.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-13-at-2.20.51 PM-1024x833.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-13-at-2.20.51 PM-768x625.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-13-at-2.20.51 PM.png 1041w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">A map depicts the proposed solar farm that would be developed on state Sen. Richard Stuart&#8217;s property in King George County. (Courtesy Caledon Solar and TerraForm Power)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A coalition of conservation groups called the Land Trust Alliance signed a letter to Voyles’ successor, Stefanie Taillon, in May saying that allowing a solar farm on easement was likely unprecedented in Virginia, and warning that the action could have “local and national implications.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents have shared mixed reviews for the project. Laurie Schlemm told the county’s planning commission in September that the easement clearly barred solar and said the previous landowner, James Nash, who’d initially set up the easement, would be &#8220;turning over in his grave&#8221; if he knew its fate. Others, like Rose Payne, said new subdivisions were a bigger threat than the solar farm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TerraForm representatives said the project would generate $11.3 million in economic benefits for the county over its 40-year lifespan, including $3 million in direct revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stuart said in an interview last week that the whole process had made him wary of easements. He noted the original easement allowed for the extraction of oil and gas and said he needed to bring in revenue to help pay property taxes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some folks in these fields believe that you should not be able to do anything but</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">look at the land and pay taxes,” he said. “And unfortunately that probably will be the downfall of this program when they&#8217;re just too rigid with people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solar farm proposal isn’t the first issue that has prompted headlines about Stuart’s property. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/headstones-black-cemetery-potomac-river/2020/10/25/3586f0d4-0d7a-11eb-8074-0e943a91bf08_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Washington Post reported he and his wife discovered headstones on the riverbanks of the property that originated from a historic African American burial ground in Washington D.C. In 2021,</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/historic-headstones-of-dc-african-americans-relocated-to-maryland/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 55 headstones were moved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to National Harmony Memorial Park in Prince George&#8217;s County, Maryland. </span></p>

The administration has also named Connor Andrews as deputy secretary of education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement on Tuesday is the latest move by the incoming administration to shape the state’s education leadership. Spanberger, who last week announced longtime educator Jeffery Smith as Virginia’s next secretary of education, reiterated her goal to </span><a href="https://abigailspanberger.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Spanberger-Education-Policy_L3.pdf?utm_source=Spanberger+for+Governor+Press+List&amp;utm_campaign=cf3f9c98d3-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_08_11_01_22_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-59a417090d-" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strengthen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all levels of education in the state, including early childhood, K-12, and colleges and universities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ms. Conway and Mr. Andrews share my deep commitment to putting Virginia’s students first, attracting and retaining world-class educators, and making strong investments at every level of our education system,” Spanberger said in a statement. “I’m proud to have them join my administration as we work to strengthen Virginia’s public schools across our commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conway has served in the Virginia Department of Education for the past seven years, most recently as chief of early learning and specialized populations. She led improvements to Virginia’s birth-to-five early childhood system and oversaw special education, behavioral health, student safety and adult education, demonstrating a commitment to supporting all learners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her education experience also includes building a nationally recognized early childhood model. Over eight years, Conway helped double the number of birth-to-five children served with public funds. In addition, she helped shape other significant legislation, including the implementation of the Virginia Literacy Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Conway said she joins Spanberger in a commitment to strengthening the state’s public schools and early childhood programs to prepare Virginia’s future workforce and empower students, families and educators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Throughout my tenure at the Virginia Department of Education, I have been inspired by the dedication of educators, stakeholders, and parents across the commonwealth. While each voice is unique, a shared purpose unites us: we believe in our children and are determined to ensure every child has every opportunity to reach their fullest potential,” Conway said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger’s administration also announced that Andrews, who co-chairs the governor-elect’s education policy committee, will transition to the Office of the Secretary of Education as deputy secretary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrews, the director of state government relations at the University of Virginia, previously served in the office of former Gov. Ralph Northam, first as a policy analyst and later as deputy policy director, where he focused on education, workforce development and labor policy. He also staffed Northam’s Children’s Cabinet, which worked to improve outcomes for children and families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The governor-elect’s education plan recognizes the critical role that our education system and institutions of higher education play in expanding opportunity and preparing students for success,” Andrews said in a statement. “I look forward to collaborating with partners across the commonwealth to ensure all Virginians have access to a world-class education.”</span></p>

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As state lawmakers trek to Richmond for the <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2026/01/12/what-to-watch-as-virginias-2026-general-assembly-returns-to-richmond/">2026 General Assembly session</a> that begins Wednesday, some state senators sought more answers from the University of Virginia at a hearing on Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hearing, hosted by the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee&#8217;s Education Subcommittee, built on a December meeting with the institution&#8217;s leadership about the governing board’s search for a new president and its decision to sign a controversial agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ agreement and the naming of Scott Beardsley as the institution&#8217;s new president last month capped a tumultuous year for UVA, which, along with other colleges, faced public scrutiny over their leadership boards after Senate leaders rejected several of outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s appointees. Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger had </span><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/11/13/spanberger-calls-uva-pause-president-search" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">urged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> UVA to hold off selecting a president until she took office and all board vacancies could be filled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday’s discussions were held ahead of the General Assembly Session so the subcommittee could better understand the UVA board&#8217;s decision-making process and address concerns raised by state leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rector Rachel Sheridan told lawmakers Monday that waiting for the full complement of the board to be filled before selecting a new president would have taken too much time, as the board was also balancing calls for the institution to have stability and leadership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our view is that the board needs to act in the best interest of the university, and every decision that we have made, the board has tried to act in the best interest of the university,” said Sheridan. “Whether that was under Rector Hardy&#8217;s leadership or under mine. I truly believe that the board and every individual have operated in the best interest of the university.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheridan said with that reasoning in mind, the board ultimately decided to hire Beardsley as the institution’s 10th president. who also attended the subcommittee hearing. Beardsley, who also attended the subcommittee hearing, is the former dean of the UVA Darden School of Business and his tenure there was defined by record academic rankings, expanding student access, and strengthening faculty excellence, the university stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November, Spanberger also said the board members “severely undermined” public confidence in their abilities amid the DOJ agreement. Lawmakers, UVA faculty, and community organizations echoed her sentiments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, the DOJ claimed UVA’s admissions, hiring, diversity, equity and inclusion programs violated federal civil rights laws and that its campus culture was inhospitable to Jewish students. The federal government’s investigations, seven in total at UVA, were part of a broader effort by President Donald Trump’s administration to align colleges and universities with its views and to crack down on DEI policies on campuses nationwide. UVA leaders refuted the claims but in October </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/10/23/uva-department-of-justice-agree-to-pause-civil-rights-investigations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed an agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the federal agency to suspend the probes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The subcommittee questioned Sheridan on the institution&#8217;s decision to enter into the agreement amid concerns by some lawmakers, mostly Democrats, that alumni and faculty opposed it and said it opened the school up to legal liability, conflicted with existing law, and infringed on state sovereignty. Two of the seven civil rights investigations were closed as of Dec. 1, 2025. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheridan pointed to a December </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/12/01/uva-interim-president-to-senators-agreement-with-doj-to-pause-probes-was-best-option-available/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">testimony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by then-interim president Paul Mahoney, who said the agreement suspended costly and disruptive investigations and preserved institutional autonomy and academic freedom. Mahoney called the DOJ agreement the “best option available to us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do think that the agreement with the DOJ was very fully explained to the committee,” Sheridan said. “If it’s necessary to discuss it again, the interim president would be the best person to do that. He negotiated that agreement. The board does not approve settlement agreements or litigation settlement agreements, but we were aware and supportive of the decision to enter into the agreement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ investigations also prompted the departure of the university’s former president Jim Ryan, who resigned in June..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/11/17/state-senators-may-call-uva-leaders-to-the-carpet-over-agreement-to-end-doj-investigations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in November that Sheridan and Vice Rector Porter Wilkinson worked with the DOJ and Youngkin’s office to pressure him to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/06/27/uva-president-jim-ryan-resigns-amid-federal-ultimatum/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senators asked Sheridan if she agreed with Ryan, noting possible differences. Sheridan neither disputed nor endorsed Ryan’s account, focusing instead on her own memory of the proceedings and a forward-looking approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m only going to comment on my recollection of events,” Sheridan said. “I have not now, nor will I ever say anything about Jim Ryan’s recollection of events. Those are his recollections of events. They’re not mine, and … I think that the tone of this conversation &#8230; is about how UVA needs to move forward. And at this juncture, I’m not going to have a ‘he said, she said,’ over what Jim Ryan put in the letter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Democratic senators expressed concern that the governing board and the institution must demonstrate a genuine commitment to fostering a diverse and equitable campus culture amid legal and political pressures. Additionally, they urged the board and institution to rebuild trust with the UVA community after recent events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We will continue to aspire to be the best public university in the country, and to be all about excellence and to deliver the best we can,&#8221; Beardsley responded to the subcommittee.</span></p>
